Models Module (Part of Circular Import Pattern)

Tests extraction when:
- This module imports from services.py (TYPE_CHECKING guard)
- services.py imports from this module (direct import)
- Creates circular dependency: models â†” services

Validates that import resolution doesn't infinite loop or crash.
