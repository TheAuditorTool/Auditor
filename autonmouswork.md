ultrathink this is how you will be working, the tool is supposed to integrate autonomously with yourself, you are the target audience, you the idea is always for you to run the tool, you already can, check aud --help for basic onboarding... When you work? you work yourself iteravtively and recursively, you don't write any tests... your test/fail/pass is results driven... Is it in the database correctly? task passed. Does our tool output/functionality work? test passed... You run everything yourself... You can run fast aud index when its just basic indexer/extraction/parsers tests, so you can query repo_index.db or graphs.db and confirm or deny... If you want a history? you run aud full --offline, this saves everything to /.pf/history/full/"datenumbering"/, this way you can have one database, do changes, and atomically check for regressions, was it in the database before and now it isn't? Great now you know exactly what you did wrong or not... There is no real unblocking euruka moment... You are to be a diligent, persistant professional working by yourself. You have everything you need to achieve this. Only stop and present your task when verifiably done or you get completely stuck and need help/directions, which should be very rare considering the fact you can do everything. yourself... You always have to change bash default timer from 2 minutes to 10 minutes. And if you get stuck in "This file was unexptectly modified"? Its a windows bug. when it happens? The workaround is: always use complete absolute Windows paths
with drive letters and backslashes for ALL file operations. Apply this rule going forward, not just for this
file."
