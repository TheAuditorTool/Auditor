## UNCOMMITTED FILES - MY PHASE 3 WORK

### Documentation Files (untracked):

1. **PHASE3_FULL_AUDIT.md** - MINE
   - Created: 2025-11-01 17:31
   - Purpose: Comprehensive audit cross-referencing all 3 aud full runs
   - Should commit: YES (audit documentation)

2. **PHASE3_PROGRESS_REPORT.md** - MINE
   - Created: 2025-11-01 05:55
   - Purpose: Progress tracking during Phase 3 implementation
   - Should commit: MAYBE (working document)

3. **PYTHON_PHASE3_AUDIT.md** - MINE
   - Created: 2025-11-01 14:49
   - Purpose: Earlier audit report (superseded by PHASE3_FULL_AUDIT.md)
   - Should commit: NO (superseded/redundant)

### Test Fixtures (untracked - NOT in my ticket):

These appear to be Phase 2 fixtures or another AI's work:
- tests/fixtures/python/celery-complex/
- tests/fixtures/python/marshmallow-complex/
- tests/fixtures/python/sqlalchemy-complex/
- tests/fixtures/python/python-celery-tasks/
- tests/fixtures/python/python-pytest-tests/
- tests/fixtures/python/python-marshmallow-schemas/
- tests/fixtures/python/python-wtforms-forms/
- tests/fixtures/python/flask_test_app.py

**Analysis**: These were created Nov 1 but are NOT mentioned in my Phase 3 proposal. They cover Phase 2 frameworks (Marshmallow, SQLAlchemy, Celery, WTForms) which were already implemented. Likely created by Phase 2 AI or testing AI.

**Claim**: NOT MINE - these are Phase 2 test fixtures
