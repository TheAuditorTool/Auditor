The file implements prohibited table existence checking and uses a non-existent column name, both of which are P0 blocking issues. Additionally, the entire 'graceful degradation' philosophy conflicts with the fail-fast schema contract design introduced in v1.1. This rule requires immediate remediation before it can be considered production-ready.",

    "learning_opportunity": "This audit reveals a fundamental architectural conflict: the rule was written before the schema contract system was implemented (v1.1+). The 'graceful degradation' approach made sense in the old model where table availability was uncertain. Now, with schema contracts, rules must assume tables exist and fail fast if they don't. This is a paradigm shift that requires updating the rule's entire error handling philosophy."
