## Key Themes Across All Docs

### 1. Installation Simplification
**Consistent Message**:
- ML dependencies installed by default
- Decision moved from install-time to runtime
- Single `pip install -e .` command
- Activation via specific commands (`aud learn --enable-git`)

### 2. Git Temporal Features
**Consistent Messaging**:
- 4x feature expansion (1 → 4 features)
- Commit frequency, team collaboration, code recency, activity patterns
- Delegates to existing metadata_collector.py (DRY)
- Optional via `--enable-git` flag
- Gracefully degrades if git unavailable

### 3. 4-Tier Intelligence
**Documented Everywhere**:
- Tier 1: Pipeline.log (macro timing)
- Tier 2: Journal.ndjson (micro events)
- Tier 3: raw/*.json (ground truth)
- Tier 4: Git history (temporal signals) - NEW

### 4. Runtime Opt-In Model
**Key Points**:
- All features installed by default
- `pipelines.py` decides what runs during `aud full`
- Manual activation via specific commands
- Graceful degradation on missing data
- Clear error messages with remediation

### 5. Backwards Compatibility
**Emphasized Throughout**:
- External API unchanged
- Existing import patterns work
- No migration required
- All changes opt-in or backwards compatible
