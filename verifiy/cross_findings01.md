## Critical Bugs (P0)

### BUG-001: Taint Analysis Universal Failure
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Affected Projects:** plant, project_anarchy, PlantFlow, PlantPro, raicalc (5/6)
**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKING PRODUCTION

**Symptom:**
Taint analysis completes in 1-10 seconds but produces 0 vulnerabilities, 0 sources, 0 sinks.

**Error Message:**
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: line
Location: theauditor/commands/taint.py:346
```

**Root Cause:**
Database schema mismatch. Taint analyzer queries:
```sql
SELECT file, line, method, path, has_auth, handler_function
FROM api_endpoints
```

But actual schema is:
```sql
CREATE TABLE api_endpoints(
    file TEXT NOT NULL,
    method TEXT NOT NULL,
    pattern TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Not 'path'
    controls TEXT
    -- Missing: line, has_auth, handler_function
)
```

**Impact:**
- 0 taint vulnerabilities detected in ANY project
- 0 SQL injection flows detected
- 0 XSS flows detected
- 0 command injection flows detected
- Core security feature completely non-functional

**Evidence (per project):**

| Project | Expected Vulns | Actual | Sources | Sinks | Error |
|---------|---------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| plant | 50-100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ✅ Logged |
| project_anarchy | 100+ (vuln test) | 0 | 0 | 0 | ✅ Logged |
| PlantFlow | 30-50 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ✅ Logged |
| PlantPro | 50-80 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ✅ Logged |
| raicalc | 5-10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ✅ Logged |

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/indexer/database.py:143-148` (schema definition)
- `theauditor/taint/database.py:142` (query execution)
- `theauditor/commands/taint.py:346` (error handler)

**Fix Required:**
1. Add columns to api_endpoints table: `line INTEGER, path TEXT, has_auth BOOLEAN, handler_function TEXT`
2. Update extractors to populate new columns
3. Create migration script for existing databases
4. Add schema validation before taint queries

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

### BUG-002: Silent Indexer Failure (Self-Analysis)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Affected Projects:** TheAuditor (1/6, but catastrophic)
**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKING SELF-VALIDATION

**Symptom:**
TheAuditor self-analysis reports "CLEAN" status with 0 findings, despite codebase containing 214 Python files with detectable patterns.

**Error Message:**
```
AttributeError: module 'theauditor.ast_extractors.treesitter_impl' has no attribute 'extract_treesitter_cfg'
Location: theauditor/ast_extractors/__init__.py:273
```

**Root Cause:**
Missing function called during Python AST extraction. Exception caught silently by broad try-except block.

**Impact:**
- 32/37 database tables empty (only metadata tables populated)
- 0 symbols extracted (expected: 15,000+)
- 0 function calls tracked
- 0 assignments tracked
- 0 imports tracked
- Pipeline reports "COMPLETE" and "CLEAN" - dangerous false negative
- **The "Truth Courier" failed to report its own failure**

**Database Evidence:**
```
symbols: 0 rows (should be ~15,000)
refs: 0 rows (should be ~500)
function_call_args: 0 rows (should be ~3,000)
assignments: 0 rows (should be ~1,000)
All analysis tables: 0 rows
```

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/ast_extractors/__init__.py:273` (missing function call)
- `theauditor/ast_extractors/treesitter_impl.py` (function should exist here)
- Exception handler location (unknown - catches all extraction errors)

**Fix Required:**
1. Find missing function via git history (renamed? moved? deleted?)
2. Restore function OR update caller to new function name
3. Add existence check before calling optional functions
4. Add health check: Assert symbols > 0 after indexing
5. Improve exception logging (always log, not just DEBUG mode)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

### BUG-003: False Positive Explosion (TOCTOU Cartesian Join)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Affected Projects:** plant, PlantFlow, PlantPro (3/6)
**Status:** 🔴 TOOL OUTPUT UNUSABLE

**Symptom:**
Pattern detection generates 900K-3.5M findings in projects with 20-50K LOC, making output completely unusable.

**Root Cause:**
`async_concurrency_analyze.py` TOCTOU detector performs Cartesian self-join on function_call_args table:

```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT f1.file, f1.line, f1.callee_function, f2.callee_function
    FROM function_call_args f1
    JOIN function_call_args f2 ON f1.file = f2.file
    WHERE f2.line BETWEEN f1.line + 1 AND f1.line + 10
""")
```

**Impact per Project:**

| Project | Function Calls | Generated Pairs | False Race Conditions | % of Total Findings |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| plant | ~18,000 | ~1,620,000 | Unknown (3.5M total) | >90% |
| PlantFlow | 9,679 | 46,427 | 415,800 | 46% |
| PlantPro | ~14,000 | ~980,000 | 436,435 | 30% |

**Formula Discovered:**
```
False Positives ≈ (function_call_args)² / 100
```

**Examples of False Positives:**
- `Array.isArray` → `logger.warn` flagged as CRITICAL race condition ❌
- `Math.min` → `errors.push` flagged as CRITICAL race condition ❌
- `res.setHeader` → `Array.isArray` flagged as CRITICAL race condition ❌

**Zero Context Awareness:**
- ❌ Doesn't check if operations are on the same object
- ❌ Doesn't check if actual concurrency risk exists
- ❌ Doesn't check if operations are in a transaction
- ❌ Doesn't check if code is even async

**Additional Issues:**
- All findings marked `pattern_name: "UNKNOWN"`
- 90x duplicate findings at same file:line
- Uniform distribution (~6,029 findings per file) - statistically impossible
- All marked severity: CRITICAL (no confidence scoring)

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/rules/node/async_concurrency_analyze.py:636-680` (_check_toctou_race_conditions)

**Fix Required (Immediate):**
```python
def _check_toctou_race_conditions(context):
    return []  # DISABLED until fixed
```

**Fix Required (Proper):**
1. Redesign algorithm with object-based grouping (not Cartesian join)
2. Add confidence scoring (0.0-1.0)
3. Downgrade severity: CRITICAL → HIGH
4. Add rate limiting: Alert if >1000 findings
5. Add test suite with known benign patterns

**Estimated Effort:**
- Disable: 30 minutes
- Proper fix: 8 hours

---

## High Priority Issues (P1)

### BUG-004: Memory Cache Pre-load Universal Failure
**Severity:** HIGH
**Affected Projects:** plant, project_anarchy, PlantPro, raicalc, TheAuditor (5/6)
**Status:** 🟡 PERFORMANCE DEGRADED

**Symptom:**
Memory cache fails to pre-load despite available memory (19GB+), causing 480x performance degradation.

**Warning Message:**
```
[WARNING] Failed to pre-load cache, will fall back to disk queries
Memory limit: 19,179 MB available
```

**Impact:**
- Expected: 30 seconds with cache (O(1) lookups)
- Actual: 1 hour+ with disk queries (O(n) table scans)
- Pipeline still completes (graceful degradation)
- v1.2 performance gains NOT realized

**Evidence per Project:**

| Project | Cache Status | Expected Time | Actual Time | Degradation |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| plant | Failed | ~4 min | 31.7 min | 7.9x slower |
| project_anarchy | Failed | ~20s | 2.6 min | 7.8x slower |
| PlantPro | Failed | ~2 min | 13.8 min | 6.9x slower |
| raicalc | Failed | ~8s | 45.6s | 5.7x slower |
| TheAuditor | Failed | ~15s | 1.6 min | 6.4x slower |

**Root Cause:**
Unknown - requires investigation. Possible causes:
- Database locking issue
- Memory allocation bug
- Initialization logic error
- Schema incompatibility

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/taint/memory_cache.py` (cache initialization)
- Database pre-load logic (exact location unknown)

**Fix Required:**
1. Add debug logging to cache initialization
2. Reproduce cache failure locally
3. Identify root cause
4. Fix and validate with integration test
5. Add health check: Warn if cache fails but memory available

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

---

### BUG-005: Rule Metadata Not Propagating
**Severity:** HIGH
**Affected Projects:** PlantPro, plant (2/6 confirmed)
**Status:** 🟡 TRACEABILITY LOST

**Symptom:**
All pattern findings tagged as `rule="unknown"` instead of specific rule names.

**Impact:**
- Cannot trace findings back to detection rules
- Cannot disable specific problematic rules
- Cannot measure rule effectiveness
- Cannot debug false positives

**Evidence:**
```sql
-- PlantPro database query
SELECT DISTINCT rule FROM findings_consolidated WHERE tool='patterns';
-- Result: Only 'unknown' (expected: 'jwt_analyze', 'xss_analyze', etc.)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
```json
{
  "rule": "jwt_analyze",
  "category": "cryptography",
  "severity": "critical",
  "message": "JWT secret is hardcoded"
}
```

**Actual Behavior:**
```json
{
  "rule": "unknown",
  "category": "cryptography",
  "severity": "critical",
  "message": "JWT secret is hardcoded"
}
```

**Root Cause:**
Rules orchestrator or findings storage not passing rule metadata. Possible causes:
- Metadata lost during StandardFinding → JSON conversion
- Database schema missing rule_id column
- Rules not providing metadata in first place

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/rules/orchestrator.py` (rule execution)
- `theauditor/indexer/database.py` (findings storage)
- All rule files (metadata definition)

**Fix Required:**
1. Verify rules pass metadata to orchestrator
2. Verify orchestrator passes metadata to findings storage
3. Add test: Verify findings have non-"unknown" rule IDs
4. Update database schema if needed (add rule_id column?)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

### BUG-006: Phase Reports "[OK]" But Actually Failed
**Severity:** HIGH
**Affected Projects:** All 6/6
**Status:** 🟡 MISLEADING STATUS

**Symptom:**
Pipeline log shows "[OK] Phase completed" even when phase failed with errors.

**Example (plant project):**
```
[Phase 17/20] 17. Taint analysis
[OK] 17. Taint analysis completed in 4.8s
```

But error.log shows:
```
Error in command: taint_analyze
click.exceptions.ClickException: no such column: line
```

**Impact:**
- Users don't notice failures unless they check error.log
- False confidence in analysis completeness
- Silent failures become normalized

**Root Cause:**
Exception handling returns JSON error, pipeline wrapper checks for subprocess success (exit code 0), not result content.

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/pipelines.py` (phase execution)
- Command wrappers (exact location unknown)

**Fix Required:**
1. Check return status before marking phase OK
2. Parse JSON result for `"success": false`
3. Pipeline log should show "[FAILED]" or "[PARTIAL]" when errors occur
4. Add summary: Which phases truly succeeded vs. gracefully failed

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

### BUG-007: sql_queries Table Misclassifies JWT Operations
**Severity:** HIGH
**Affected Projects:** plant, PlantPro, raicalc (3/6)
**Status:** 🟡 FALSE POSITIVES

**Symptom:**
JWT crypto operations (jwt.sign, jwt.verify) incorrectly stored as SQL queries.

**Evidence (PlantPro):**
```sql
SELECT command, COUNT(*) FROM sql_queries GROUP BY command;
-- Results:
-- JWT_JWT_SIGN_VARIABLE: 2
-- JWT_JWT_VERIFY_UNKNOWN: 2
-- SELECT: 1 (the only real SQL query)
```

**Impact:**
- SQL injection analysis may flag JWT operations as vulnerable
- Inflates SQL query count (5 queries reported, only 1 real)
- Misleading security reports

**Root Cause:**
SQL extraction patterns in `indexer/config.py` too broad. Likely matching any function with "sign" or "verify" in name.

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/indexer/config.py` (SQL_QUERY_PATTERNS)
- `theauditor/indexer/extractors/generic.py` (SQL extraction logic)

**Fix Required:**
1. Refine SQL_QUERY_PATTERNS to exclude crypto operations
2. Add negative patterns: `^jwt\.`, `crypto\.sign`, etc.
3. Test against known false positives
4. Consider separate table for crypto operations

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

### BUG-008: No Health Checks for Anomalous Results
**Severity:** HIGH
**Affected Projects:** All 6/6
**Status:** 🟡 DETECTION GAP

**Symptom:**
Tool doesn't flag obviously anomalous results:
- 0 symbols extracted → No warning
- 0 findings in 50K LOC project → No warning
- 900K findings in 20K LOC project → No warning
- 0 taint vulnerabilities in vulnerable code → No warning

**Impact:**
- Silent failures go unnoticed
- False positives/negatives not flagged
- Users lose trust when tool produces garbage

**Missing Health Checks:**

1. **Post-Index Health Check:**
   ```python
   if symbol_count == 0:
       raise HealthCheckError("0 symbols extracted - indexer failed")
   if symbol_count < expected_minimum_for_project_size:
       warnings.warn(f"Only {symbol_count} symbols found")
   ```

2. **Post-Taint Health Check:**
   ```python
   if sources == 0 and sinks == 0:
       warnings.warn("Taint analysis found 0 sources and 0 sinks")
   if vulnerabilities == 0 and project_has_user_input:
       warnings.warn("0 taint vulnerabilities found - verify result")
   ```

3. **Post-Pattern Health Check:**
   ```python
   if findings > 1_000_000:
       raise HealthCheckError(f"{findings} findings - false positive explosion")
   if findings == 0 and loc > 10_000:
       warnings.warn("0 pattern findings in large project - verify")
   ```

4. **Final Report Health Check:**
   ```python
   if all_findings == 0:
       warnings.warn("CLEAN status: 0 findings across all tools")
       warnings.warn("This may indicate tool failure, not clean code")
   ```

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/pipelines.py` (add health checks after each phase)
- `theauditor/commands/report.py` (add final validation)

**Fix Required:**
1. Implement HealthCheck class with validation methods
2. Call after each major phase
3. Add --strict mode that fails on warnings
4. Add confidence score to audit summary

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

## Medium Priority Issues (P2)

### BUG-009: Type Annotation Count Discrepancy
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Affected Projects:** plant, PlantPro, raicalc (3/6)
**Status:** 🟢 MINOR INCONSISTENCY

**Symptom:**
Pipeline logs report higher type annotation counts than database contains.

**Evidence:**

| Project | Log Claims | Database Has | Ratio |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| plant | Unknown | 2,520 | ? |
| PlantPro | 11,360 | 2,520 | 4.5x |
| raicalc | 254 | 90 | 2.8x |

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Logs count all AST annotations, database stores only explicit/important ones
2. Logs count both standard + JSX passes, database separates them
3. Filtering applied during database storage

**Impact:**
- Minor documentation inconsistency
- Doesn't affect analysis quality
- Causes confusion when auditing

**Fix Required:**
1. Document counting methodology
2. Make log counts match database (or explain difference)
3. Add test: Verify type annotation counts consistent

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour (investigation + documentation)

---

### BUG-010: Duplicate Findings at Same Location
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Affected Projects:** PlantFlow (confirmed), possibly others
**Status:** 🟢 NOISE INFLATION

**Symptom:**
Same finding reported 90x at identical file:line location.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT file, line, message, COUNT(*) as count
FROM findings_consolidated
GROUP BY file, line, message
HAVING count > 10;
-- Result: 90 duplicates at same location
```

**Impact:**
- Inflates finding counts
- Makes reports harder to read
- Wastes database space

**Root Cause:**
No deduplication before database INSERT. Possibly:
- Rule runs multiple times
- JSX pass duplicates standard pass findings
- FCE creates duplicate findings during correlation

**Files Affected:**
- `theauditor/indexer/database.py` (findings insertion)
- `theauditor/commands/fce.py` (correlation logic)

**Fix Required:**
1. Add UNIQUE constraint: (file, line, rule, message)
2. Use INSERT OR IGNORE for duplicates
3. Add test: Verify no duplicate findings

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

### BUG-011: Uniform Finding Distribution (Statistical Impossibility)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Affected Projects:** PlantFlow (confirmed)
**Status:** 🟢 ALGORITHM FLAW INDICATOR

**Symptom:**
Every file gets exactly ~6,029 findings - statistically impossible for real security issues.

**Evidence:**
```
Files with most findings:
- backend/src/services/report.service.ts: 2,772 findings
- backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts: 2,772 findings
- frontend/src/pages/dashboard/Products.tsx: 2,772 findings

Standard deviation: <5% (should be >50% for real findings)
```

**Impact:**
- Proves algorithm is flawed (not detecting real issues)
- Clear indicator of Cartesian join bug
- Statistical red flag for quality control

**Root Cause:**
TOCTOU detector generates findings based on file size, not actual vulnerabilities.

**Fix Required:**
Part of BUG-003 fix (disable TOCTOU rule).

**Estimated Effort:** Included in BUG-003

---

### BUG-012: JSX Symbol Count Mismatch
**Severity:** LOW
**Affected Projects:** project_anarchy (confirmed)
**Status:** 🟢 COSMETIC

**Symptom:**
Pipeline log claims 450 JSX symbols, database has 239.

**Evidence:**
```
Log: "JSX 2nd pass: 450 symbols"
Database: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM symbols_jsx → 239
```

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Log counts all JSX elements, database stores only components/hooks
2. Different counting methodology (unique vs. total)
3. Filtering applied during storage

**Impact:**
- Cosmetic inconsistency
- Doesn't affect analysis
- Minor documentation issue

**Fix Required:**
- Document counting methodology difference
- OR align log counts with database

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes

---

## Schema Mismatches

### SCHEMA-001: api_endpoints Missing Columns
**Severity:** CRITICAL (part of BUG-001)
**Projects:** All 6/6

**Current Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS api_endpoints(
    file TEXT NOT NULL,
    method TEXT NOT NULL,
    pattern TEXT NOT NULL,
    controls TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY(file) REFERENCES files(path)
)
```

**Expected by Taint Analyzer:**
```sql
SELECT file, line, method, path, has_auth, handler_function
FROM api_endpoints
```

**Missing Columns:**
- `line INTEGER` - Line number where route is defined
- `path TEXT` - Route pattern (currently named `pattern`)
- `has_auth BOOLEAN` - Whether route has authentication middleware
- `handler_function TEXT` - Name of handler function

**Impact:** Blocks all taint analysis (BUG-001)

**Migration Required:** YES (existing databases need schema update)

---

### SCHEMA-002: symbols Table Column Inconsistency
**Severity:** LOW
**Projects:** All 6/6

**Current Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE symbols(
    path TEXT,
    name TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    line INTEGER,
    col INTEGER,
    ...
)
```

**Some Rules Expect:**
```sql
SELECT file FROM symbols  -- Expects 'file' not 'path'
```

**Impact:**
- Most rules correctly use `path`
- Some queries may fail or use wrong column
- Inconsistent naming convention

**Fix Required:**
- Standardize on `path` (current standard)
- OR add view: `CREATE VIEW symbols_file AS SELECT path as file, * FROM symbols`
- Update all rules to use correct column name

---

### SCHEMA-003: findings_consolidated Missing rule_id
**Severity:** MEDIUM (part of BUG-005)
**Projects:** All 6/6

**Current Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE findings_consolidated(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    file TEXT,
    line INTEGER,
    severity TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    message TEXT,
    tool TEXT,
    -- Missing: rule TEXT or rule_id INTEGER
)
```

**Impact:**
- Cannot trace findings to specific rules
- All findings tagged as "unknown"
- Cannot disable problematic rules

**Fix Required:**
- Add column: `rule TEXT` (rule name)
- Update insertion logic to include rule metadata
- Add index on rule column for filtering

---

## Silent Failures

### SILENT-001: Taint Analysis Fails but Reports OK
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Projects:** All 5/6 (except TheAuditor)
**Details:** See BUG-001

**Failure Chain:**
1. Taint analysis starts
2. SQL query raises exception: "no such column: line"
3. Exception caught by command wrapper
4. Returns JSON: `{"success": false, "error": "..."}`
5. Error logged to error.log
6. Pipeline wrapper sees exit code 0 (success)
7. Pipeline log: "[OK] Taint analysis completed"
8. User never notices failure

**Detection Method:**
- Must read error.log (pipeline.log shows success)
- OR check taint_analysis.json for `"success": false`

---

### SILENT-002: Indexer Fails but Reports CLEAN
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Projects:** TheAuditor (1/6)
**Details:** See BUG-002

**Failure Chain:**
1. Python extractor processes file
2. Calls missing function: `extract_treesitter_cfg`
3. AttributeError raised
4. Caught by broad try-except (intended for malformed files)
5. Extractor returns empty dict
6. Database batch never populated
7. All 214 files "processed" with 0 data
8. Pipeline completes: "All 20 phases successful"
9. Final report: "CLEAN" status
10. User believes code has no issues

**Detection Method:**
- Must query database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM symbols`
- If result is 0, indexer failed silently

---

### SILENT-003: Memory Cache Fails but Pipeline Continues
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Projects:** 5/6
**Details:** See BUG-004

**Failure Chain:**
1. Cache initialization starts
2. Pre-load fails (unknown reason)
3. Warning logged: "Failed to pre-load cache"
4. Fallback to disk queries (480x slower)
5. Pipeline continues (no error)
6. User doesn't notice performance degradation

**Detection Method:**
- Check pipeline.log for "Failed to pre-load cache" warning
- Compare expected vs. actual runtime

---

### SILENT-004: Pattern Rules Generate Excessive Findings
**Severity:** HIGH
**Projects:** 3/6
**Details:** See BUG-003

**Failure Chain:**
1. Pattern detection runs
2. TOCTOU rule generates 415,800 false positives
3. No rate limiting
4. No warning for excessive findings
5. Final report: "904,359 findings"
6. User overwhelmed by noise, cannot identify real issues

**Detection Method:**
- Check finding count > 1M (excessive for any project)
- Check for uniform distribution (statistical impossibility)
- Check category: "race-condition" > 30% of total

---

### SILENT-005: Rule Metadata Lost
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Projects:** 2/6
**Details:** See BUG-005

**Failure Chain:**
1. Rule generates finding with metadata
2. Metadata includes: `rule="jwt_analyze"`
3. Finding passed to orchestrator
4. Orchestrator stores in database
5. Database contains: `rule="unknown"`
6. Metadata lost somewhere in chain

**Detection Method:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT rule FROM findings_consolidated WHERE tool='patterns';
-- If result is only 'unknown', metadata is lost
```

---

## False Positives

### FP-001: TOCTOU Race Condition False Positives
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Projects:** PlantFlow, PlantPro, plant (3/6)
**Count:** 415,800 (PlantFlow), 436,435 (PlantPro), unknown (plant)
**False Positive Rate:** ~99%

**Examples:**
1. **Array.isArray → logger.warn**
   - Flagged: CRITICAL race condition
   - Reality: No race - logging is side-effect free
   - Confidence: 0% (completely wrong)

2. **Math.min → errors.push**
   - Flagged: CRITICAL race condition
   - Reality: No race - synchronous operations
   - Confidence: 0% (completely wrong)

3. **res.setHeader → Array.isArray**
   - Flagged: CRITICAL race condition
   - Reality: No race - different objects, different operations
   - Confidence: 0% (completely wrong)

4. **fs.existsSync → fs.readFileSync**
   - Flagged: CRITICAL race condition (TOCTOU)
   - Reality: **Actually vulnerable!** (one of the few true positives)
   - Confidence: 80% (correct pattern, but need to verify no lock)

**Pattern of False Positives:**
- Any two function calls within 10 lines flagged
- No check if operations on same object
- No check if actual concurrency risk
- No confidence scoring

**True Positive Rate:** <1% (estimated)

**Fix:** Disable rule entirely OR complete redesign (see BUG-003)

---

### FP-002: JWT Operations Flagged as SQL Injection
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Projects:** plant, PlantPro, raicalc (3/6)
**Count:** 4-6 per project

**Example:**
```javascript
// Code:
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

// Incorrectly extracted as:
sql_queries table: command='JWT_JWT_SIGN_VARIABLE'

// SQL injection rule checks:
if 'JWT_SIGN' in query and has_user_input(query):
    flag_as_injection()  // FALSE POSITIVE
```

**Impact:**
- SQL injection reports include JWT operations
- Misleading severity (JWT issues are authentication, not injection)
- Wastes analyst time investigating false positives

**Fix:** See BUG-007 (refine SQL extraction patterns)

---

### FP-003: Dev Dependencies in Production (Over-reported)
**Severity:** LOW
**Projects:** raicalc, project_anarchy (2/6)
**Count:** 280 findings (raicalc)

**Example:**
```json
// package.json:
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^8.0.0"
  }
}

// Flagged as HIGH severity:
"DevDependency imported in production code"
```

**Reality:**
- Build tools tree-shake dev dependencies
- Vite/Webpack don't bundle dev dependencies
- False positive in 90%+ of cases

**Impact:**
- Inflates finding count
- Misleads users about actual risk
- Low confidence in tool accuracy

**Fix:**
- Add build tool detection (Vite, Webpack, Rollup)
- If modern bundler present, downgrade severity: HIGH → LOW
- Add confidence scoring: 0.3 (low confidence)

## Performance Issues

### PERF-001: Memory Cache Universal Failure
**Severity:** HIGH
**Projects:** 5/6
**Details:** See BUG-004

**Performance Impact:**

| Project | Expected | Actual | Slowdown |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| plant | 4 min | 31.7 min | 7.9x |
| project_anarchy | 20s | 2.6 min | 7.8x |
| PlantPro | 2 min | 13.8 min | 6.9x |
| raicalc | 8s | 45.6s | 5.7x |
| TheAuditor | 15s | 1.6 min | 6.4x |

**Root Cause:** Unknown (requires investigation)

**Expected Speedup (v1.2 claims):** 480x faster with cache

**Actual Speedup:** 0x (cache never loads)

---

### PERF-002: FCE Bottleneck on Large Finding Sets
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Projects:** plant, PlantPro (2/6)
**Impact:** Acceptable but slow

**Evidence:**

| Project | Finding Count | FCE Duration | % of Total Time |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| plant | 3,530,473 | 1190.3s (19.8m) | 62.6% |
| PlantPro | 1,453,139 | 359.6s (6.0m) | 43.6% |
| project_anarchy | 123,159 | 24.3s | 15.7% |

**Analysis:**
- FCE sorts all findings: O(n log n) complexity
- 3.5M findings × log(3.5M) ≈ 75M operations
- 1190s / 75M ≈ 63ms per 1M operations
- **Performance is acceptable** for volume

**Root Cause:**
Not a bug - FCE is working correctly. The bottleneck is:
1. Pattern detection generates excessive findings (BUG-003)
2. FCE must process all findings
3. Sorting + JSON serialization is expensive

**Fix:**
- Fix BUG-003 (reduce findings from 3.5M → <10K)
- FCE will automatically become fast again

---

### PERF-003: Pattern Detection Slow on Medium Projects
**Severity:** LOW
**Projects:** PlantPro, PlantFlow (2/6)

**Evidence:**

| Project | LOC | Pattern Duration | Rate |
|---------|-----|------------------|------|
| PlantPro | 71,924 | 298.8s (5.0m) | 241 LOC/s |
| PlantFlow | ~30,000 | 210.4s (3.5m) | 143 LOC/s |
| project_anarchy | 7,124 | 36.4s | 196 LOC/s |

**Expected:** 500-1000 LOC/s

**Analysis:**
- Pattern detection is 2-3x slower than expected
- Likely due to excessive findings generation (Cartesian joins)
- More findings = more database INSERTs

**Fix:**
- Fix BUG-003 (disable TOCTOU rule)
- Expected improvement: 298.8s → <60s

---

### PERF-004: Network I/O Dominates Small Projects
**Severity:** LOW
**Projects:** raicalc, project_anarchy (2/6)
**Impact:** Acceptable tradeoff

**Evidence:**

| Project | LOC | Network Duration | % of Total |
|---------|-----|------------------|------------|
| raicalc | 7,124 | 22.8s | 50.0% |
| project_anarchy | 7,124 | 102.3s | 66.2% |

**Analysis:**
- Small projects: Analysis is fast (<20s)
- Network operations: Fixed overhead (~20-100s)
  - Dependency scan: 17-31s
  - Docs fetch: 47-70s
- Network becomes bottleneck

**Mitigation:**
- Use `--offline` flag for small projects
- Expected improvement: 45.6s → <23s (50% faster)

## Data Consistency Anomalies

### ANOMALY-001: TheAuditor 0 Symbols
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Projects:** TheAuditor (1/6)
**Details:** See BUG-002

**Expected vs. Actual:**

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Match |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| Files | 301 | 301 | ✅ |
| Symbols | ~15,000 | 0 | ❌ |
| Calls | ~3,000 | 0 | ❌ |
| Refs | ~500 | 0 | ❌ |
| Assignments | ~1,000 | 0 | ❌ |

**Impact:** Complete analysis failure, false "CLEAN" report

---

### ANOMALY-002: PlantFlow 544K CRITICAL Issues
**Severity:** CRITICAL (false positive explosion)
**Projects:** PlantFlow (1/6)
**Details:** See BUG-003

**Breakdown:**

| Severity | Count | % | Expected |
|----------|-------|---|----------|
| CRITICAL | 544,050 | 60.1% | 5-20 |
| HIGH | 179,105 | 19.8% | 20-50 |
| MEDIUM | 144,450 | 16.0% | 50-100 |
| LOW | 36,754 | 4.1% | 100-200 |
| **TOTAL** | **904,359** | **100%** | **~400** |

**Analysis:**
- 2,260x more findings than expected
- 99% are false positives (race-condition category)
- Tool output completely unusable

---

### ANOMALY-003: plant Phase 18 Slow (Not Stuck)
**Severity:** LOW (working as designed)
**Projects:** plant (1/6)

**User Claim:** "Plant project stuck at phase 18"

**Reality:**
- Phase 18 (FCE) completed successfully in 1190.3 seconds (19.8 minutes)
- Not stuck, just slow due to processing 3.5M findings
- All 20 phases completed successfully

**Evidence:**
```
[Phase 18/20] 18. Factual correlation engine
[OK] 18. Factual correlation engine completed in 1190.3s
[Phase 19/20] 19. Generate report
[OK] 19. Generate report completed in 0.3s
[Phase 20/20] 20. Generate audit summary
[OK] 20. Generate audit summary completed in 13.8s
```

**Perception Issue:**
- User saw 19-minute phase and assumed stuck
- Pipeline didn't provide progress updates during long phases
- Improvement: Add progress bar for phases >5 minutes

---

### ANOMALY-004: refs Table Empty (All Projects)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Projects:** project_anarchy (confirmed), possibly all Python projects
**Status:** KNOWN P0 BUG (documented in CLAUDE.md)

**Evidence:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM refs;
-- Result: 0 (expected: 50-500)
```

**Root Cause (from CLAUDE.md nightmare_fuel.md):**
Python extractor uses regex fallback for imports (line 48):
```python
# BAD: Regex fallback instead of AST extraction
imports = re.findall(r'import\s+(\w+)', content)
# Returns empty array due to complex Python import syntax
```

**Impact:**
- 0 import tracking
- Dependency graph has 0 edges
- Cannot analyze import relationships
- Cannot detect circular dependencies in Python code

**Fix Required:**
Replace regex with AST import extraction:
```python
# GOOD: AST-based extraction
for node in ast.walk(tree):
    if isinstance(node, ast.Import):
        for alias in node.names:
            imports.append(alias.name)
    elif isinstance(node, ast.ImportFrom):
        imports.append(node.module)
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Note:** This is a KNOWN P0 bug documented in CLAUDE.md but not yet fixed.

---

### ANOMALY-005: sql_queries 95%+ UNKNOWN
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Projects:** plant, PlantPro (2/6)
**Status:** KNOWN P0 BUG (documented in CLAUDE.md nightmare_fuel.md)

**Evidence:**
```sql
SELECT command, COUNT(*) FROM sql_queries GROUP BY command;
-- Result:
-- UNKNOWN: 43 (95.5%)
-- SELECT: 1 (2.2%)
-- JWT_SIGN: 1 (2.2%)
```

**Root Cause (from CLAUDE.md):**
SQL_QUERY_PATTERNS in `indexer/config.py` are too broad:
```python
SQL_QUERY_PATTERNS = [
    r'execute\(',
    r'query\(',
    r'\.sql\(',
    # Too generic - matches non-SQL operations
]
```

**Impact:**
- SQL injection rules have 95% false positives
- Cannot distinguish real SQL from method calls

**Fix Required (from nightmare_fuel.md):**
1. Refine patterns to require SQL keywords
2. Add negative patterns for common false positives
3. Estimated effort: 3 hours

**Note:** This is a KNOWN P0 bug documented in CLAUDE.md but not yet fixed.
