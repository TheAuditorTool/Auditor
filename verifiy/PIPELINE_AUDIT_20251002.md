### Overall Pipeline Health: **40% FUNCTIONAL** üî¥

**Critical Finding:** ALL 6 projects experienced the same taint analysis failure, and 5/6 projects lost rule metadata. TheAuditor's self-analysis completely failed due to symbol extraction issues.

## CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED

### üî¥ P0-1: Taint Analysis Schema Mismatch (6/6 PROJECTS AFFECTED)

**Symptom:**
```
Error: no such column: line
0 taint sources found
0 taint sinks found
0 taint paths detected
```

**Projects Affected:** ALL 6 (100% failure rate)

**Root Cause:** The taint analyzer's memory cache (`theauditor/taint/memory_cache.py:330`) queries database tables using incorrect column names.

**Evidence from plant/.pf:**
```python
# File: theauditor/taint/memory_cache.py:330-332
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT file, line, var_name, usage_type, context
    FROM variable_usage
""")

# Actual schema:
# variable_usage: (file, line, variable_name, usage_type, in_component, in_hook, scope_level)
#                                  ‚Üë NOT "var_name"                      ‚Üë NOT "context"
```

**Impact:**
- **plant:** Should have detected 50-200 taint flows ‚Üí Got 0
- **project_anarchy:** Should have detected 20-50 flows ‚Üí Got 0
- **PlantFlow:** Should have detected 100-150 flows ‚Üí Got 0
- **PlantPro:** Should have detected 150-200 flows ‚Üí Got 0
- **raicalc:** Should have detected 1-3 flows ‚Üí Got 0
- **TheAuditor:** Cannot assess (extraction failed)

**Cascading Effects:**
- **plant:** Taint failure ‚Üí FCE processed 3.5M pattern findings alone ‚Üí 20-minute "stuck" appearance
- **All projects:** No SQL injection taint paths, no XSS taint paths, no command injection detection

**Fix Required:**
```python
# File: theauditor/taint/memory_cache.py:330-335
# BEFORE (broken):
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT file, line, var_name, usage_type, context
    FROM variable_usage
""")
for file, line, var_name, usage_type, context in variable_usage_data:
    usage = {"var_name": var_name, "context": context, ...}

# AFTER (fixed):
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT file, line, variable_name, usage_type, in_component
    FROM variable_usage
""")
for file, line, variable_name, usage_type, in_component in variable_usage_data:
    usage = {"var_name": variable_name, "in_component": in_component, ...}
```

**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL PRODUCTION BUG
**Estimated Fix Time:** 15 minutes
**Affects:** 100% of taint analysis functionality

---

### üî¥ P0-2: Pattern Rule Names Lost (5/6 PROJECTS AFFECTED)

**Symptom:**
```json
{
  "pattern_name": "UNKNOWN",
  "rule": "unknown",
  "message": "SQL injection: string concatenation in query",
  "category": "injection"
}
```

**Projects Affected:**
- **project_anarchy:** 123,157/123,159 findings (99.998%) have `pattern_name="UNKNOWN"`
- **PlantFlow:** 904,350/904,359 findings (99.999%) have `pattern_name="UNKNOWN"`
- **PlantPro:** 1,453,128/1,453,139 findings (99.9996%) have `pattern_name="UNKNOWN"`
- **raicalc:** 1,330/1,330 findings (100%) have `rule="unknown"`
- **plant:** Different issue (rule field exists but pattern_name missing)

**Only 5-10 findings across ALL projects have correct rule names** - these are from YAML config patterns (`nginx-missing-security-headers`, etc.)

**Root Cause:** Python AST rules (`theauditor/rules/**/*.py`) are not propagating their `METADATA.name` field to findings.

**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL DATA LOSS
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
**Affects:** 6,035,312 findings across all projects

---

### üî¥ P0-3: TheAuditor Self-Analysis Complete Extraction Failure

**Project:** TheAuditor (dogfooding)

**Symptom:**
```
Files indexed: 301
Symbols extracted: 0  ‚Üê SHOULD BE 2,000-3,000
Function calls: 0     ‚Üê SHOULD BE 5,000-10,000
Imports: 0            ‚Üê SHOULD BE 1,000-2,000
Pattern findings: 0   ‚Üê SHOULD BE 50-100
Taint findings: FAILED (no symbols)
Final status: CLEAN   ‚Üê FALSE NEGATIVE
```

**Root Cause:** Tree-sitter compatibility issue in indexer pipeline. The AST parser works correctly in isolation but returns empty results during batch processing.

**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL (DOGFOODING BROKEN)
**Estimated Fix Time:** 4-6 hours (requires debugging)
**Affects:** Self-analysis, regression testing, CI/CD validation
