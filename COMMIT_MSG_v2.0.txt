feat!: TheAuditor v2.0 - Polyglot Code Intelligence Platform

BREAKING: This release fundamentally transforms TheAuditor from a
Python/JavaScript SAST tool into a polyglot code intelligence platform.
Schema changes require full reindexing. Several commands removed.

## Polyglot Language Expansion

Add Go, Rust, and Bash language support with full static analysis:

- Go: tree-sitter AST, HTTP/ORM detection, taint analysis, 4 DFG strategies
- Rust: 20 tables, unsafe block analysis, FFI boundaries, Cargo workspace support
- Bash: security-focused analysis, command injection, quoting issues

All languages now wire into unified taint engine and graph infrastructure.

## Schema Consolidation

Python schema collapsed from 149 tables to 8 core + junction tables:

- 22MB database size reduction
- 3x query performance improvement
- JSON blob columns eliminated
- Proper FK constraints enforced
- Node.js schema normalized with 8 junction tables
- 106 rules migrated to fidelity layer (schema-aware, fail-loud)

## Zero Fallback Policy

Systematic elimination of silent failures across entire codebase:

- Removed try/except fallbacks returning empty results
- Extraction failures crash pipeline instead of continuing
- Database query failures exposed instead of hidden
- 20+ modules refactored to comply

The cardinal rule: No silent failures. Crash loud. Debug fast.

## Performance Optimizations

Query and I/O performance dramatically improved:

- SQL Recursive CTEs replace Python loops (95x faster incoming calls)
- O(N) ghost imports detection (was O(N^2))
- O(1) graph node lookup (was O(N))
- Single os.walk replaces 15x rglob calls
- WAL mode + 64MB cache for SQLite
- In-memory taint analysis (no temp files)
- Async parallel linter execution

## CLI Modernization

Complete user experience overhaul:

- Rich-formatted help for all 80+ subcommands
- AI-optimized --help descriptions
- 42 workflow guides in `aud manual`
- New `aud explain` command for code context
- Unified Loguru logging (92 missed prints fixed)
- `aud taint` replaces `taint-analyze`

Removed commands: `aud index` (use `--index`), `aud init`, `aud summary`

## Architecture Documentation

26 new architecture documents:

- 12 core module docs (indexer, extractors, graph, taint, FCE, rules,
  linters, MachineL, pipeline, context, session, commands)
- 14 feature docs (planning, refactor, context, manual, rich help,
  explain, blueprint, boundaries, deadcode, session, agents, query,
  MachineL features, impact)

## Codebase Hygiene

Aggressive cleanup to reduce AI hallucination risk:

- 15,952 comments purged
- 280+ ruff lint errors fixed
- Dead code removed: snapshots.py, config_runtime.py, treesitter_impl.py,
  Contributing.md, .pf/readthis/ system
- `insights/` renamed to `MachineL/` with flattened structure

## Infrastructure

- Pipeline observer pattern for event-driven architecture
- FCE vector-based consensus engine rewrite
- pygit2 shadow sidecar repository for planning
- Async HTTP client (httpx) for dependency checking
- Pydantic validation for FCE schemas

## Breaking Changes

- Requires Python >=3.14 (was 3.12)
- Existing .pf/ databases incompatible (reindex required)
- Graph builder uses Strategy Pattern (language-specific logic extracted)
- Commands removed: `aud index`, `aud init`, `aud summary`
- Command renamed: `taint-analyze` -> `taint`

## Dependencies

Added: rich>=13.0.0, loguru==0.7.3, pydantic==2.12.4, httpx>=0.28.0,
       pygit2>=1.14.0, libcst==1.8.6 (dev)
Updated: mypy 1.18.2 -> 1.19.0

## Stats

- 385 commits
- 1169 files changed
- +286,176 / -156,702 lines
- ~320 hours development time

Migration: Delete .pf/, run `aud full`. Update scripts using removed commands.
