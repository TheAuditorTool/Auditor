**Assigned To**: [AI Coder Executing Implementation]

**Approval Required From**: Architect (Human)

## Prime Directive: Verify Before Acting

**From teamsop.md v4.20**:

> This directive overrides all other instructions. It is a read-first, act-second protocol. **Assumptions are forbidden**. All beliefs about the codebase must be treated as hypotheses to be proven or disproven by directly reading the source code before any other action is taken.

**Protocol**: Question Everything, Assume Nothing, Verify Everything.

**Mandate**: Before writing or modifying a single line of code, you MUST perform a Verification Phase. The output of this phase is recorded below. You must explicitly list your initial hypotheses and then present the evidence from the code that confirms or refutes them.

---

## Verification Methodology

### 1. Hypotheses from Investigation Report

For each finding in `INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md`, verify:
- ‚úÖ **File exists** at reported path
- ‚úÖ **Line numbers accurate** (code may have changed since investigation)
- ‚úÖ **Anti-pattern exists** as described
- ‚úÖ **Impact assessment realistic** (measure if possible)

### 2. Verification Checklist

- [ ] Read all source files mentioned in investigation report
- [ ] Verify each code snippet matches current codebase
- [ ] Document any discrepancies (code changed since investigation)
- [ ] Re-measure performance if discrepancies found
- [ ] Update tasks.md if implementation plan needs adjustment
