# Verification Report: AWS CDK Analysis Implementation

**Change ID**: `add-aws-cdk-analysis`
**Verification Date**: 2025-10-30
**Verifier**: Opus (Lead Coder AI)
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - Ready for implementation with corrections

---

## Overview

This document records the pre-implementation verification phase required by teamsop.md v4.20. All hypotheses about existing architecture were tested against actual codebase before implementation began.

---

## Architecture Hypotheses & Verification

### ✅ Hypothesis 1: Schema Contract System
**Claim**: Schema uses `TableSchema` dataclass pattern from schema.py

**Verification**: CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Read `theauditor/indexer/schema.py:38-60`
- **Pattern**: `@dataclass class Column: name: str, type: str, nullable: bool, ...`
- **Conclusion**: Proposal design.md:390-405 matches exactly

### ✅ Hypothesis 2: Database Batch Operations
**Claim**: Database uses 200-record batches via generic_batches dictionary

**Verification**: CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Read `theauditor/indexer/database.py:53-55`
- **Pattern**: `self.generic_batches: Dict[str, List[tuple]] = defaultdict(list)`
- **Batch Size**: DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE = 200 (database.py:35-51)
- **Conclusion**: Proposal tasks.md:119-125 follows existing pattern

### ✅ Hypothesis 3: 3-Layer File Path Responsibility
**Claim**: Implementation returns no file_path, extractor receives file_info, orchestrator adds file_path

**Verification**: CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Read `theauditor/indexer/extractors/terraform.py:44-64`
- **Pattern**:
  - Extractor receives `file_info` dict with 'path' key
  - Extractor returns dicts WITHOUT file_path keys
  - Orchestrator adds file_path when calling db_manager
- **Conclusion**: Proposal design.md:297-309 respects 3-layer separation

### ✅ Hypothesis 4: Rules Auto-Discovery
**Claim**: Rules auto-discovered by RulesOrchestrator scanning /rules/ directory

**Verification**: CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Read `theauditor/rules/orchestrator.py:110-150`
- **Pattern**: `_discover_all_rules()` walks rules_dir, imports modules, finds functions
- **Discovery**: Looks for `find_*` and `analyze` functions with StandardRuleContext
- **Conclusion**: Drop rule file in `/rules/deployment/`, orchestrator finds it

### ✅ Hypothesis 5: StandardRuleContext Contract
**Claim**: Rules use `analyze(context: StandardRuleContext) -> List[StandardFinding]` signature

**Verification**: CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Read `theauditor/rules/base.py:32-73`
- **Contract**: `StandardRuleContext` dataclass with file_path, content, language, db_path
- **Return**: Rules return `List[StandardFinding]`
- **Conclusion**: Proposal tasks.md:434 follows contract

### ⚠️ Hypothesis 6: Python AST Implementation Location
**Claim**: New extraction goes in `theauditor/ast_extractors/python_impl.py`

**Verification**: INCORRECT - Module deprecated
- **Evidence**: Read `theauditor/ast_extractors/python_impl.py:3-14`
- **Deprecation Notice**: "This module is DEPRECATED (2025-10-30) - kept for rollback safety only"
- **New Location**: `theauditor/ast_extractors/python/` directory
- **Resolution**: Create `theauditor/ast_extractors/python/cdk_extractor.py` instead
- **Decision**: Architect approved Option B - separate cdk_extractor.py module

### ❌ Hypothesis 7: Analyzer Module Location
**Claim**: Analyzer goes in `theauditor/analyzers/aws_cdk_analyzer.py`

**Verification**: INCORRECT - Directory doesn't exist
- **Evidence**: Ran `ls -la theauditor/ | grep -E "^d"`
- **Finding**: No `/analyzers/` directory exists in codebase
- **Correct Pattern**: Examined `theauditor/terraform/analyzer.py`
- **Resolution**: Create `theauditor/aws_cdk/analyzer.py` (module-specific folder)
- **Terraform Pattern**:
  ```
  theauditor/terraform/
  ├── analyzer.py      ← TerraformAnalyzer class
  ├── graph.py         ← Graph builder
  └── parser.py
  ```
- **CDK Pattern** (corrected):
  ```
  theauditor/aws_cdk/
  └── analyzer.py      ← AWSCdkAnalyzer class
  ```

### ✅ Hypothesis 8: Zero Fallback Policy
**Claim**: NO fallbacks, NO table checks, hard crash on schema errors

**Verification**: CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Read `CLAUDE.md` absolute prohibitions section
- **Contract**: Schema guarantees tables exist, missing table = bug
- **Proposal Compliance**: README.md:157-193, design.md:651-654, spec.md:274-280
- **Conclusion**: Proposal explicitly forbids fallbacks

### ✅ Hypothesis 9: No Conflicting Proposals
**Claim**: No active OpenSpec proposals modify same files

**Verification**: CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Ran `openspec list` → 10 active proposals
- **Analysis**:
  - `python-extraction-phase2-modular-architecture` refactors existing Python extraction
  - CDK adds NEW files only (python/cdk_extractor.py, aws_cdk/, rules/deployment/)
  - Zero file conflicts between proposals
- **Conclusion**: Safe to proceed in parallel

### ✅ Hypothesis 10: Pipeline Integration Pattern
**Claim**: Pipeline uses `command_order` list in pipelines.py

**Verification**: CONFIRMED
- **Evidence**: Read `theauditor/pipelines.py:30-100`
- **Pattern**: Command timeouts defined, command_order list structure
- **Integration Point**: Add `("cdk", ["analyze"])` to command_order after terraform
- **Conclusion**: Simple one-line addition to pipeline

## Critical Discrepancies & Resolutions

### DISCREPANCY #1: Python AST Module Location
**Issue**: Proposal references deprecated `python_impl.py`
**Impact**: HIGH - Could cause merge conflicts with Phase 2 refactoring
**Resolution**: Create `theauditor/ast_extractors/python/cdk_extractor.py` (Option B approved)
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Architect approved separation

### DISCREPANCY #2: Analyzer Directory Structure
**Issue**: Proposal creates `analyzers/aws_cdk_analyzer.py` but directory doesn't exist
**Impact**: HIGH - Wrong directory structure
**Resolution**: Create `theauditor/aws_cdk/analyzer.py` following terraform pattern
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Corrected to match existing architecture

### DISCREPANCY #3: Tasks.md Section 0 Empty
**Issue**: tasks.md:32-40 has placeholder but no verification content
**Impact**: LOW - Blocks implementation per teamsop.md
**Resolution**: Populate with verification findings (this document)
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Being completed now

## Risk Assessment

### LOW RISK Components
- Schema/Database layers (well-established patterns)
- Rules layer (auto-discovery works)
- Pipeline integration (one-line addition)

### MEDIUM RISK Components
- AST extraction (new CDK pattern detection)
- Property value serialization (complex expressions)

### NO RISK
- File conflicts (working in parallel with Python parity)
- Architecture violations (all patterns verified)

---

## Confidence Level: HIGH

All critical architecture patterns have been verified against live codebase. The two major discrepancies (Python module location, analyzer directory) have been identified and resolved. Implementation can proceed with confidence following the corrected file structure.

**Ready to begin Phase 1 (Schema + Database) implementation.**
