# Python Extraction Phase 3 - Complete Package

**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Author**: Lead Coder (Opus AI)

---

## WHAT THIS IS

A complete, ironclad proposal for Python Extraction Phase 3 that any AI can pick up and implement without additional context. This builds on Phase 2's success (49 extractors, 2,723 records) to achieve 70% Python/JavaScript parity.

## HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE

### For a New AI Session (Cold Start)

1. **Read in this order**:
   ```
   1. This README.md (you are here)
   2. proposal.md (understand the goals)
   3. IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (learn how to build extractors)
   4. design.md (understand architecture decisions)
   5. tasks.md (see what needs doing)
   6. verification.md (understand testing approach)
   ```

2. **Start implementation**:
   - Pick up from Task 2 (Task 1 is complete)
   - Follow session plan in tasks.md
   - Use verification.md to test hypotheses
   - Update STATUS.md after each session

3. **Verification pattern**:
   - Before: State hypothesis in verification.md
   - During: Implement following IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
   - After: Record results in verification.md

### For the Architect (Human)

**Decision Points**:
- Approve proposal.md objectives
- Review design.md decisions
- Gate reviews after Blocks 1, 3, 5

**What you get**:
- 30 new Python extractors
- 70% Python/JavaScript parity
- <10ms per file performance
- Complete documentation

### For the Lead Auditor (Gemini AI)

**Review Focus**:
- Security patterns (Block 3)
- Performance metrics (Block 5)
- Integration testing (Block 6)
- Regression prevention

**Quality Gates**:
- After Flask block: Continue/stop
- After Security block: Continue/stop
- After Performance block: Continue/stop
