## WHAT CHANGED

### From Proposal to Reality

**Proposed (Original)**:
- 30 extractors across 4 phases
- 40 tasks over 20 sessions
- Performance optimization
- Complete integration testing

**Actual Implementation**:
- 25 extractors (5 fewer - optimized scope)
- 10 tasks (simplified from 40 - removed redundancy)
- 7 tasks complete, 1 failed, 2 pending
- Performance: Not optimized (deferred)
- Integration: Partially blocked by external issues

**Why the changes**:
1. Combined redundant extractors (fewer, more powerful)
2. Prioritized functionality over optimization
3. Simplified task structure for clarity
4. External blocker (taint analysis broken)

---

## WHAT WORKED

### Technical Decisions ✅

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - 4 separate files (flask_, security_, django_, testing_extractors.py)
   - Easy to navigate and maintain
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Schema-Driven Approach**
   - 24 tables with clear naming (python_flask_*, python_security_*, etc.)
   - Schema contract enforced
   - No migrations needed (regenerate fresh)

3. **Zero-Fallback Policy**
   - Hard failures only
   - No try/except hiding bugs
   - All issues surfaced immediately

4. **Test Fixtures**
   - Realistic patterns (832 lines total)
   - OWASP vulnerabilities
   - Complex business logic
   - Quality over quantity

### Process Decisions ✅

1. **Results-Driven Testing**
   - Query database to verify
   - No unit tests (direct verification)
   - Faster iteration

2. **Agent-Based Verification**
   - 3 specialized sub-agents
   - Comprehensive audit across 4 projects
   - High confidence in results

3. **Atomic Documentation**
   - Single source of truth
   - Simplified from 40 to 10 tasks
   - Clear status indicators

---

## WHAT DIDN'T WORK

### Technical Issues ❌

1. **Flask Route Test Failing**
   - Expected: 6 routes
   - Actual: 0 routes
   - Root cause: UNKNOWN
   - Impact: Blocks Flask validation
   - Time wasted: ~2 hours debugging

2. **ORM Deduplication Bug**
   - UNIQUE constraint violations
   - Took 2 hours to fix
   - Now resolved

3. **External Dependencies**
   - Taint analysis broken (Track A)
   - Blocks my security validation
   - Not my code to fix

### Process Issues ⚠️

1. **Documentation Drift**
   - Tasks marked complete when not verified
   - Status out of sync with reality
   - Took 2 hours to audit and fix

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Original 40 tasks too granular
   - Caused confusion and redundancy
   - Simplified to 10 tasks

3. **Test Coverage**
   - No systematic verification initially
   - Had to employ agents for audit
   - Should have verified incrementally

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### For Next Time

1. **Verify Incrementally**
   - Don't wait until end to verify
   - Check database after each extractor
   - Catch issues early

2. **Keep Docs Synced**
   - Update STATUS.md after each session
   - Don't batch documentation updates
   - Avoid drift

3. **Start with Simpler Tests**
   - Flask route test too complex
   - Should have started with basic patterns
   - Build complexity gradually

4. **Coordinate with Other AIs**
   - Taint analysis broke during my work
   - Should have flagged earlier
   - Regular sync-ups needed

### For Future AIs

1. **Read HANDOFF.md First**
   - Don't trust old docs
   - Verify against source code
   - Start with current state

2. **Use Sub-Agents**
   - Don't try to audit everything yourself
   - Specialized agents are powerful
   - Parallel verification saves time

3. **Focus on Quality**
   - 25 good extractors > 30 mediocre ones
   - Real-world test fixtures matter
   - Zero-fallback policy works

## NEXT SESSION RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority
1. Debug Flask route test failure (BLOCKER)
2. Update STATUS.md and proposal.md (sync docs)

### Medium Priority
3. Performance optimization (memory cache, profiling)
4. Complete systematic verification

### Low Priority (Blocked)
5. Integration testing with taint analysis (wait for Track A fix)
6. Security pattern validation (depends on taint)
