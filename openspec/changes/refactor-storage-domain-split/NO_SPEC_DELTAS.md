# No Spec Deltas Required

**Change Type**: Pure Refactoring (Code Organization Only)

---

## Why No Spec Deltas?

This change is a **pure code organization refactor** with:

- ✅ **Zero functional changes** - All 107 handlers retain identical behavior
- ✅ **Zero API changes** - Public interface (`DataStorer`) unchanged
- ✅ **Zero capability changes** - No new features, no removed features
- ✅ **Zero database schema changes** - All tables remain unchanged
- ✅ **100% backward compatible** - Import path unchanged, existing tests pass

## What Changed?

**Internal Implementation Only**:
- Split `storage.py` (2,127 lines) into 5 domain-specific modules
- Created `storage/` package with same public API
- Organized handlers by domain (core, python, node, infrastructure)

**What Did NOT Change**:
- Extraction capabilities (Python, Node, Infrastructure)
- Handler behavior (identical database operations)
- Data flow (same inputs, same outputs)
- Performance characteristics

## Affected Specs

**None.** The `python-extraction` spec documents WHAT is extracted (ORM models, routes, Flask apps, etc.), not HOW it's stored internally. This refactor changes storage module organization, not extraction capabilities.

## OpenSpec Validation

This change intentionally has no spec deltas because:

1. **Refactoring** = Code organization, not requirement changes
2. **Specs document capabilities** = What the system does, not how code is organized
3. **Internal implementation** = Storage module structure is not user-facing

If OpenSpec validation fails due to missing deltas, this is expected and correct. The proposal, design, and tasks documents provide comprehensive documentation of the refactoring work.

## Validation Alternative

If spec deltas are required by policy, we could add a trivial note to `specs/python-extraction/spec.md`:

```markdown
## Implementation Notes (Non-Normative)

**v1.3.1 (2025-01-01)**: Storage layer refactored from monolithic `storage.py` (2,127 lines) into domain-specific modules (`core_storage.py`, `python_storage.py`, `node_storage.py`, `infrastructure_storage.py`). This change is internal implementation only - extraction capabilities and behavior are unchanged.
```

However, this would clutter the spec with implementation details that don't affect requirements.

---

**Recommendation**: Accept that this refactor-only change has no spec deltas. Use `verification.md`, `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` for documentation instead.

**OpenSpec Policy Question**: Should refactoring-only changes require spec deltas, or should they be exempt from the "must have at least one delta" validation rule?
