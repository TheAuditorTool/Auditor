## Lessons Learned

### Template Works Well
- The 16-section template is comprehensive but not overwhelming

### Windows Path Bug Handled
- Always use absolute paths: `C:\Users\santa\Desktop\TheAuditor\...`
- Edit tool works reliably with absolute Windows paths
- No file modification errors encountered in this session

### Consistent Quality Matters
- Following template religiously ensures consistency
- Each command took ~5-10 minutes to enhance
- Pattern recognition speeds up later commands

### Performance Benchmarks Important
- Users want to know how long commands take
- Small/Medium/Large categories work well
- Speedup metrics (10-100x) are compelling
