Map to CWEs: The cwe field in your findings is also null. Mapping your findings to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a standard practice for security tools. It would make your reports more valuable for security professionals and would help with compliance and reporting. This is a highly recommended improvement.
make sure that FCE and/or other consumers get that field filled so it can extract it for downstream shananigans...
