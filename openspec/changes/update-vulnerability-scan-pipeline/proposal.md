## Why
- `aud full` reports clean dependency scans even on repositories with known CVEs because the new database-first scanner exits before hitting the native tools when `package_configs` is empty (`theauditor/vulnerability_scanner.py:77-83`).
- The indexer never stores Python dependency manifests in `package_configs` (`theauditor/indexer/extractors/json_config.py:63-72`), so Python-heavy projects permanently hit the empty-inventory path.
- Missing native binaries (pip-audit, OSV) raise exceptions that `scan_dependencies` downgrades to empty findings (`theauditor/vulnerability_scanner.py:775-793`), violating the SOP verify-before-acting loop.
- Because `_write_to_json` only runs after a successful scan, `.pf/raw/vulnerabilities.json` is absent; the pipeline summary and downstream OSV automation lose their evidence trail.

## What Changes
- Expand the indexing contract so `package_configs` captures Python manifests (`requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) and any other supported ecosystems needed by the scanners.
- Teach `VulnerabilityScanner.scan()` to fall back to the freshly parsed dependency list when the database lacks coverage, while logging discrepancies for auditability.
- Always emit `.pf/raw/vulnerabilities.json` (even when zero findings) and surface the full tool matrix in the payload (`sources_used`, `tool_status`).
- Treat missing tool binaries or command failures as hard errors: propagate structured errors to the CLI/pipeline and flag the phase as failed instead of returning an empty list.
- Update `aud deps --vuln-scan` and the pipeline summary to consume the richer status object, so report generation and OSV ingestion can trust the artifact.
- Document the new guarantees in the security scanning spec and SOP-aligned runbook notes.

## Impact
- Restores deterministic evidence for dependency security scanning, enabling OSV ingestion and truthful pipeline summaries.
- Ensures Python and mixed-language repositories receive complete coverage without manual database priming.
- Aligns CLI behavior with SOP v4.20 by failing loudly when verification prerequisites (tooling, inventory) are unmet.

## Verification Alignment
- Verification log captured in `openspec/changes/update-vulnerability-scan-pipeline/verification.md` per SOP v4.20.
- Tasks include Phase 0 checkpoints to repeat the database/tooling validation before implementation.
- Design will document fallback vs. failure policy to keep Truth Courier guarantees explicit.
