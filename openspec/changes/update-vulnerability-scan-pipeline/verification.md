SOP Reference: Standard Operating Procedure v4.20

## Hypotheses & Evidence

1. Vulnerability scanner should always emit `.pf/raw/vulnerabilities.json` even when no findings occur.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/vulnerability_scanner.py:77-109` returns early when package inventory is empty, so `_write_to_json` never runs.
   - Result: ❌ False.

2. `aud index` populates `package_configs` for both Node and Python dependency files.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/indexer/extractors/json_config.py:63-72` only inserts `package.json` metadata; `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` are not captured.
   - Result: ❌ False.

3. Missing native scanners (pip-audit, OSV) cause `aud deps --vuln-scan` to fail loudly.
   - Evidence: Exceptions are swallowed in `scan_dependencies` (`theauditor/vulnerability_scanner.py:775-793`), returning an empty list and leaving the CLI to print `[OK]` (`theauditor/commands/deps.py:95-112`).
   - Result: ❌ False.

4. Node projects without `node_modules` still produce vulnerability findings via OSV lockfile scanning.
   - Evidence: `_run_npm_audit` aborts when `node_modules` is missing (`theauditor/vulnerability_scanner.py:157-166`), and `_run_osv_scanner` requires lockfiles that may not exist (`theauditor/vulnerability_scanner.py:413-430`).
   - Result: ⚠️ Partially true; OSV helps only when lockfiles exist.

## Discrepancies & Alignment Notes
- Database-first migration broke Python coverage because `package_configs` never sees `requirements.txt`; scanner must either ingest the parsed dependency list or fail instead of silently passing.
- Output contract drift (`vulnerability_analysis.json` vs `vulnerabilities.json`) is secondary; the real blocker is that `scan()` exits early and suppresses tool errors.
- CLI and pipeline messaging violate SOP's verify-before-acting principle by advertising success without evidence artifacts.

## Conclusion
The vulnerability scanning stage currently produces no artifacts for Python-heavy repositories, for Node repos without installed modules, and whenever native tool binaries are absent. The proposal mandates database coverage for all ecosystems, deterministic JSON emission, and explicit failure reporting so downstream tooling and auditors receive verifiable evidence.
