## Why

**Current Architecture State (v1.3.0-RC1):**
- Vulnerability scanner (theauditor/vulnerability_scanner.py) already implements dual-write pattern: findings_consolidated table + .pf/raw/vulnerabilities.json
- findings_consolidated.details_json column already exists for structured metadata (theauditor/indexer/schemas/core_schema.py:502)
- FCE already reads from findings_consolidated.details_json for graph/CFG correlation (theauditor/fce.py:50-98)
- OSV-Scanner extracts CWE data but only stores first CWE ID (vulnerability_scanner.py:416-421), discarding additional CWE classifications

**Gaps:**
1. **CWE Data Loss**: OSV database_specific.cwe_ids is an array, but we only store cwe_ids[0] in findings_consolidated.cwe (single TEXT column). Downstream FCE consumers cannot see full CWE taxonomy.
2. **CVE/GHSA Aliasing**: CVE and GHSA IDs stored in aliases array but not individually indexed in details_json for direct FCE queries like "show all CVE-2024-* vulnerabilities".
3. **Python Manifest Coverage**: OSV-Scanner reads requirements.txt but package_configs table doesn't capture pyproject.toml [tool.poetry.dependencies] or pip-tools outputs, creating gaps for polyglot projects.
4. **Polyglot Detection**: Projects like C:\Users\santa\Desktop\fakeproj\project_anarchy (Python + Node monorepo) may have incomplete dependency inventories if manifest files aren't indexed properly.

**What This Breaks:**
- FCE cannot correlate vulnerabilities by full CWE taxonomy (e.g., "all CWE-79 XSS findings across SAST + OSV")
- `aud query` cannot filter vulnerabilities by specific CVE IDs stored in aliases (requires JSON parsing instead of direct column query)
- Python-only projects without requirements.txt but with pyproject.toml get zero vulnerability coverage
- Polyglot project dependency counts are inconsistent between `aud deps` output and actual manifest files

## What Changes

**NO MIGRATIONS. NO FALLBACKS. NO TABLE CHANGES.**
Database is regenerated fresh every `aud index` run. All changes are data enrichment only.

### 1. Enhanced CWE Storage (findings_consolidated.details_json)
**File**: theauditor/vulnerability_scanner.py:416-442

**Before** (vulnerability_scanner.py:416-421):
```python
cwe = ""
db_specific = vuln.get("database_specific", {})
if db_specific and "cwe_ids" in db_specific:
    cwe_ids = db_specific["cwe_ids"]
    if isinstance(cwe_ids, list) and len(cwe_ids) > 0:
        cwe = cwe_ids[0]  # Take first CWE only
```

**After**:
```python
# Extract ALL CWEs for full taxonomy coverage
cwe_ids = []
db_specific = vuln.get("database_specific", {})
if db_specific and "cwe_ids" in db_specific:
    raw_cwes = db_specific["cwe_ids"]
    if isinstance(raw_cwes, list):
        cwe_ids = raw_cwes  # Store full array

# Backward compat: findings_consolidated.cwe gets first CWE (existing queries)
cwe_primary = cwe_ids[0] if cwe_ids else ""
```

Store in details_json (vulnerability_scanner.py:423-440):
```python
vulnerability = {
    "package": pkg_name,
    # ... existing fields ...
    "cwe": cwe_primary,  # Backward compat for findings_consolidated.cwe column
    "cwe_ids": cwe_ids,  # NEW: Full array in details_json for FCE
    "cve_id": next((a for a in aliases if a.startswith("CVE-")), None),  # NEW: Direct CVE access
    "ghsa_id": next((a for a in aliases if a.startswith("GHSA-")), None),  # NEW: Direct GHSA access
    "source": "OSV-Scanner"
}
```

When writing to findings_consolidated (vulnerability_scanner.py:601-619):
```python
# details_json column gets full structured data
import json
details = {
    "cwe_ids": finding.get("cwe_ids", []),  # Full CWE array
    "cve_id": finding.get("cve_id"),
    "ghsa_id": finding.get("ghsa_id"),
    "aliases": finding.get("aliases", []),
    "references": finding.get("references", [])[:5],  # Limit for size
    "source_count": finding.get("source_count", 1),
    "confidence": finding.get("confidence", 0.7)
}

self.cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO findings_consolidated
    (file, line, column, rule, tool, message, severity, category,
     confidence, code_snippet, cwe, timestamp, details_json)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
""", (
    file_path,
    0,
    None,
    finding.get("vulnerability_id"),  # rule = CVE-2021-23337 or GHSA-xxxx
    "vulnerability_scanner",
    finding.get("summary"),
    finding.get("severity", "medium"),
    "dependency",
    finding.get("confidence", 0.7),
    f"{finding.get('package')}@{finding.get('version')}",
    finding.get("cwe", ""),  # Primary CWE (backward compat)
    timestamp,
    json.dumps(details)  # NEW: Structured metadata for FCE
))
```

### 2. Python Manifest Enhancement (Indexer)
**File**: theauditor/indexer/extractors/json_config.py (or new python_manifest.py)

Extend package_configs population to support:
- pyproject.toml [tool.poetry.dependencies] (Poetry)
- pyproject.toml [project.dependencies] (PEP 621)
- requirements-*.txt variants (dev, test, prod)
- pip-tools exports (requirements.in â†’ requirements.txt)

**Implementation**:
```python
# theauditor/indexer/extractors/python_manifest.py (NEW or extend json_config.py)
import tomli  # Or tomllib for Python 3.11+

def extract_pyproject_deps(content: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Extract dependencies from pyproject.toml for package_configs."""
    deps = []
    try:
        data = tomli.loads(content)

        # PEP 621 (standard)
        if "project" in data and "dependencies" in data["project"]:
            for dep_spec in data["project"]["dependencies"]:
                name, version = parse_requirement(dep_spec)
                deps.append({"name": name, "version": version, "manager": "py"})

        # Poetry
        if "tool" in data and "poetry" in data["tool"]:
            poetry_deps = data["tool"]["poetry"].get("dependencies", {})
            for name, spec in poetry_deps.items():
                if name == "python":
                    continue
                version = spec if isinstance(spec, str) else spec.get("version", "*")
                deps.append({"name": name, "version": version, "manager": "py"})

    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to parse pyproject.toml: {e}")

    return deps
```

Register in indexer to populate package_configs:
```python
# theauditor/indexer/extractors/__init__.py
from .python_manifest import PythonManifestExtractor
register_extractor(PythonManifestExtractor)
```

### 3. Polyglot Detection Enhancement
**File**: theauditor/commands/deps.py:75-80

Ensure `aud deps` discovers all manifest types:
```python
# Current: Only checks package.json, requirements.txt
# Enhancement: Add pyproject.toml, Pipfile, Cargo.toml, etc.

manifest_patterns = [
    "package.json",
    "requirements*.txt",
    "pyproject.toml",  # NEW
    "Pipfile",         # NEW
    "Cargo.toml",      # NEW (future Rust support)
]
```

### 4. FCE Query Enhancement (Downstream Consumer)
**File**: theauditor/fce.py (no changes needed, already supports details_json)

FCE already queries details_json (fce.py:50-98). Once we store cwe_ids array, FCE can do:
```python
# FCE correlation example (future enhancement)
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT file, line, rule, details_json
    FROM findings_consolidated
    WHERE tool='vulnerability_scanner'
    AND json_extract(details_json, '$.cwe_ids') LIKE '%CWE-79%'
""")
```

### 5. `aud query` Integration
**Current**: `aud query` can already filter findings_consolidated by rule, tool, severity
**Enhancement**: Add examples for CVE/GHSA queries using details_json

```bash
# Query all CVE-2024-* vulnerabilities
aud query --table findings_consolidated --filter "rule LIKE 'CVE-2024-%'" --tool vulnerability_scanner

# Query all XSS vulnerabilities (CWE-79) across SAST + OSV
# (Requires SQLite JSON functions)
aud query --custom "SELECT file, line, rule FROM findings_consolidated
  WHERE json_extract(details_json, '$.cwe_ids') LIKE '%CWE-79%'"
```

## Impact

**Immediate**:
- Downstream FCE consumers (fce.py:50-98) get full CWE taxonomy for cross-tool correlation
- `aud query` can filter vulnerabilities by CVE/GHSA IDs without JSON parsing
- Python projects with pyproject.toml get full vulnerability coverage (no more gaps)
- Polyglot projects get accurate dependency counts across all manifest types

**No Breaking Changes**:
- findings_consolidated.cwe column unchanged (backward compat for existing queries)
- details_json is additive only (existing JSON readers ignore new fields)
- .pf/raw/vulnerabilities.json gains cwe_ids/cve_id/ghsa_id fields (optional)

**Philosophy Alignment**:
- TheAuditor remains a **truth courier**: We report ALL CWE IDs from OSV, we don't filter or recommend
- Database-first: All data queryable via `aud query` and `aud context`, no /readthis/ JSON fallbacks
- Zero fallbacks: If OSV data is incomplete, we store empty arrays (hard truth, not graceful degradation)

## Verification

Run `aud full --offline` before and after changes, compare:
1. `.pf/repo_index.db` findings_consolidated row count (should be same or higher)
2. `.pf/raw/vulnerabilities.json` structure (should have cwe_ids array)
3. Query CWE coverage: `sqlite3 .pf/repo_index.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM findings_consolidated WHERE json_array_length(json_extract(details_json, '$.cwe_ids')) > 1"`

Expected: Projects with OSV findings should show multiple CWEs per vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2021-23337 maps to [CWE-1321, CWE-915])
