# Fix Taint Sink Registration Pattern Mismatch

## Why

The `api_auth_analyze.py` rule registers 43 URL path patterns ("user", "token", "password") as taint sinks. The taint analyzer interprets these as variable names, creating 589 false positive findings and degrading performance 6x (3.9min â†’ 23.7min).

**Root Cause**: Semantic mismatch between rule intent (URL endpoint detection) and registry usage (variable/function name matching).

**Evidence**: Database analysis confirms 3918 sinks registered (vs 95 hardcoded), with garbage patterns present in dynamic sinks. The registry integration exposed a latent bug in rule pattern registration.

## What Changes

- **Fix `api_auth_analyze.py`**: Remove or refactor `register_taint_patterns()` to NOT register URL patterns as taint sinks (lines 542-543)
- **Audit 22 rules**: Check all rules with `register_taint_patterns()` for similar pattern mismatches
- **Add registry validation**: Reject patterns that match common variable names ("user", "token", "password", "admin", "config")
- **Performance restoration**: Return to 3.9min analysis time with 95-353 legitimate sinks

**Impact**: Eliminates 589 false positives, restores 6x performance improvement.

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: `taint-analysis` (sink registration)
- **Affected code**:
  - `theauditor/rules/security/api_auth_analyze.py:542-543` (primary fix)
  - `theauditor/taint/registry.py` (add validation)
  - 22 rules with `register_taint_patterns()` (audit)
- **Breaking changes**: None (removes false positives only)
- **Performance impact**: -6x (from 23.7min back to 3.9min)

## Non-Goals

- Revert registry integration (registry is correct and provides value)
- Remove SENSITIVE_OPERATIONS patterns entirely (still valid for URL matching rules)
- Change taint analyzer sink matching logic
