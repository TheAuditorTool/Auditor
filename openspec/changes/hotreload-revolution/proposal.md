# Proposal: Hot Reload Revolution - Incremental Indexing System

**Change ID**: `hotreload-revolution`
**Type**: Architecture Enhancement (Major) + Performance Optimization
**Status**: PROPOSED - Awaiting Approval
**Risk Level**: HIGH (Core indexing infrastructure change)
**Breaking Change**: NO (Opt-in via `--incremental` flag and `aud watch` command)
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks (foundation 2-3 days, file watching 3-4 days, hardening 2-3 days)

## Executive Summary

### The Vision

Transform TheAuditor from a batch-oriented tool requiring full 15-30 second rebuilds into an **interactive development companion** with **1-2 second incremental updates** that seamlessly integrates with AI-driven workflows.

**Current Reality**: Fix 5 files → wait 30 seconds for full rebuild → analyze → repeat
**Future State**: Fix 5 files → wait 2 seconds for incremental update → analyze → iterate rapidly

**ROI**: **15-30x speedup** for typical development loops where 5-10 files change out of 2,000 total files.

### The Problem (Three-Pronged)

**Problem 1: AI Workflow Friction (60% Priority)**
- Claude fixes 10 security issues across 10 files
- Must pause and run slow `aud index` (15-30 seconds)
- Breaks flow, kills momentum, reduces iteration speed
- **Quote**: "you fix a bunch of security issues... then you have to pause and essentially run a slow full index again"

**Problem 2: Development Loop Tax**
- Every code change requires full database regeneration
- 2,000 files re-indexed even if only 5 changed
- 95% of indexing work is duplicate (unchanged files)
- AST cache helps parsing (70% speedup) but extraction/storage still runs

**Problem 3: No Real-Time Capability**
- No file watching infrastructure
- No HMR (Hot Module Reload) equivalent for SAST
- Database always stale relative to filesystem
- Manual `aud index` required before every analysis

### The Solution (Incremental Indexing + File Watching)

**Phase 1: Hash-Based Incremental** (`aud index --incremental`)
- Compare current SHA256 hashes vs previous manifest
- Only re-index changed/new/deleted files
- Delete old data for changed files, insert fresh data
- **Speedup**: 15-30x for small changesets

**Phase 2: File Watching Service** (`aud watch`)
- Watchdog-based filesystem monitoring
- Auto-trigger incremental index on file save (debounced 1-2 seconds)
- Background daemon mode (start once, always up-to-date)
- **Experience**: Zero manual `aud index` commands

**Phase 3: AI Integration** (Claude Code Hooks)
- Post-edit hook triggers incremental index
- Claude fixes code → auto-indexed → ready for analysis
- Seamless loop: fix → verify → repeat
- **Impact**: Enables rapid iteration on security fixes

## Why This Change

### Root Cause: Architecture Never Designed for Incremental Updates

**Timeline of Missed Opportunity**:
- **Month 1**: Built for 30-table schema, full rebuild acceptable (5 seconds)
- **Month 3**: 70+ tables, full rebuild now 15 seconds (should have added incremental)
- **Month 6**: 151 tables, full rebuild 30 seconds (incremental now critical)
- **Current**: No incremental logic exists, every run regenerates everything

**The Pattern**: Database regeneration was acceptable at small scale, never optimized as project grew.

### Existing Infrastructure (70% Already Built)

**We Already Have**:
1. ✅ **SHA256 File Hashing** (`compute_file_hash()` in `utils/helpers.py`)
   - Every file tracked with content hash
   - Used by AST cache for hit detection
   - Ready for change detection

2. ✅ **Workset System** (`theauditor/workset.py`)
   - Git diff integration (subprocess-based)
   - Dependency graph traversal (forward/reverse imports)
   - File subset filtering (12 commands support `--workset`)
   - Manifest.json generation (path + sha256 for all files)

3. ✅ **AST Cache** (`theauditor/cache/ast_cache.py`)
   - SHA256-keyed persistent cache
   - LRU eviction (1GB/20K files limit)
   - 70% speedup on parsing already
   - Ready for incremental reuse

4. ✅ **File-Scoped Database Schema** (118 of 151 tables)
   - Tables have `file`, `path`, or `file_path` columns
   - Can be deleted per-file with `DELETE WHERE file = ?`
   - Extractors already process files independently
   - No schema changes needed

5. ✅ **Manifest System** (`.pf/manifest.json`)
   - Complete file inventory with SHA256 hashes
   - Regenerated every `aud index` run
   - Perfect baseline for change detection

### What's Missing (30% New Work)

**Gap 1: Change Detection Service**
- Load previous manifest (`.pf/manifest.previous.json`)
- Compare current SHA256 vs previous SHA256
- Classify files: new, modified, deleted, unchanged
- **Effort**: 1 day

**Gap 2: Incremental Database Update**
- `delete_file_records(file_path)` - Remove old data for changed file
- Handle junction table cascade (6 normalized tables)
- CFG ID remapping (AUTOINCREMENT handling)
- **Effort**: 2 days

**Gap 3: Cross-File Dependency Invalidation**
- Track "which files import file X" (reverse dependency)
- Rebuild JavaScript global function cache from database (not batch parsing)
- Re-run parameter resolution after incremental update
- **Effort**: 1 day

**Gap 4: File Watching Infrastructure** (Optional Phase 2)
- Watchdog library integration (new dependency ~500KB)
- Debouncing logic (wait 1 second after last change)
- Background daemon mode (start/stop/restart)
- **Effort**: 3-4 days

**Gap 5: AI Integration** (Optional Phase 3)
- Post-edit hook for Claude Code
- Automatic incremental index after AI edits
- **Effort**: 1 day

## What Changes

### High-Level Architecture

**BEFORE** (Full Rebuild Every Time):
```
User runs: aud index

1. Walk directory (all 2,000 files)
2. Compute SHA256 for all 2,000 files
3. Check AST cache for all 2,000 files (70% hit, 30% parse)
4. Extract data from all 2,000 files (even if cached AST)
5. DELETE FROM every table (116 tables, all data)
6. INSERT INTO every table (all 2,000 files worth of data)
7. Cross-file resolution (JavaScript parameter names)
8. Database commit

Time: 15-30 seconds for 2,000 files
```

**AFTER** (Incremental with 5 Files Changed):
```
User runs: aud index --incremental

1. Load previous manifest (path + sha256 for all files)
2. Walk directory (all 2,000 files)
3. Compute SHA256 for all 2,000 files
4. Compare: 5 files changed, 1,995 unchanged
5. For 5 changed files only:
   - Delete old data: DELETE WHERE file = ?
   - Check AST cache (may still hit if content identical)
   - Extract data from 5 files
   - INSERT INTO tables (5 files worth of data)
6. Cross-file resolution (rebuild cache from database)
7. Database commit
8. Save current manifest as previous

Time: 1-2 seconds for 5 changed files (15-30x faster)
```

**AFTER** (File Watching with Auto-Update):
```
User runs: aud watch (once at session start)

[Daemon starts, watches filesystem]

User edits file A → save
  ↓ (1 second debounce)
Daemon: Incremental index file A (0.5 seconds)
  ↓
Database up-to-date

User edits files B, C, D → save all
  ↓ (1 second debounce after last save)
Daemon: Incremental index files B, C, D (1 second)
  ↓
Database up-to-date

User runs: aud taint --workset (immediately, no manual index needed)
  ↓
Analysis uses fresh database

Time: Zero manual index commands, always up-to-date
```

### Files Changed

**NEW FILES** (5 files):
- `theauditor/commands/watch.py` - File watching daemon command (~200 lines)
- `theauditor/indexer/incremental.py` - Incremental indexing logic (~300 lines)
- `theauditor/indexer/change_detector.py` - File change detection (~150 lines)
- `theauditor/indexer/file_watcher.py` - Watchdog integration (~200 lines)
- `tests/test_incremental_indexing.py` - Comprehensive tests (~400 lines)

**MODIFIED FILES** (4 files):
- `theauditor/commands/index.py` - Add `--incremental` flag, call incremental logic
- `theauditor/indexer/orchestrator.py` - Support incremental mode (skip unchanged files)
- `theauditor/indexer/database/base_database.py` - Add `delete_file_data()` method
- `theauditor/indexer/extractors/javascript.py` - Rebuild global cache from database

**TOTAL NEW CODE**: ~1,250 lines (core incremental logic + file watching + tests)

### What's Sacred (DO NOT TOUCH)

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS** (from CLAUDE.md):
- ❌ DO NOT modify AST extractors (`ast_extractors/javascript_impl.py`, `python_impl.py`)
- ❌ DO NOT change database schema (all 151 tables remain identical)
- ❌ DO NOT modify extractor interfaces (file-local extraction must remain)
- ❌ DO NOT introduce fallback logic (violates ZERO FALLBACK POLICY)
- ❌ DO NOT use regex on file content for indexing

**Preserved Capabilities**:
- ✅ Full rebuild always available (`aud index --full` or default `aud index`)
- ✅ All 151 tables populated identically (incremental vs full = same result)
- ✅ AST cache still used (unchanged files = cache hit)
- ✅ Parameter resolution still works (cross-file JavaScript params)
- ✅ Framework detection still works (validation, ORM, GraphQL)
- ✅ All existing commands unchanged (`aud taint`, `aud fce`, etc.)

## Impact

### Performance Improvement

**Baseline** (Current Full Rebuild):
- **Small project** (500 files): 5-10 seconds
- **Medium project** (2,000 files): 15-30 seconds
- **Large project** (10,000 files): 60-120 seconds

**With Incremental** (5 files changed):
- **Small project**: 0.5-1 second (10x faster)
- **Medium project**: 1-2 seconds (15-30x faster)
- **Large project**: 2-3 seconds (30-40x faster)

**With File Watching** (auto-update):
- **Developer experience**: Zero manual `aud index` commands
- **Lag time**: 1-2 seconds after file save (debounced)
- **Always fresh**: Database never stale

### AI Workflow Improvement

**BEFORE** (Manual Full Rebuild):
```
Claude: "I found 10 security issues. Let me fix them."
  → Edits 10 files
  → [User must manually run: aud index (wait 30 seconds)]
  → Claude: "Now running analysis to verify..."
  → Analysis uses fresh database
  → Claude: "All issues resolved!"

Total time: 30 seconds of mandatory waiting
Friction: High (manual step, context switch)
```

**AFTER** (Auto-Incremental with Watch Daemon):
```
Claude: "I found 10 security issues. Let me fix them."
  → Edits 10 files
  → [Daemon auto-indexes in background: 2 seconds]
  → Claude: "Now running analysis to verify..."
  → Analysis uses fresh database (no user action needed)
  → Claude: "All issues resolved!"

Total time: 2 seconds of automatic background update
Friction: Zero (seamless, no user intervention)
```

**Impact**: Enables rapid iteration on security fixes without breaking flow.

### Developer Velocity

**Adding New Framework Support** (Example):

**BEFORE** (Full Rebuild):
1. Add table to schema.py
2. Extract data in javascript_impl.py
3. Store in node_database.py
4. Test: `aud index` (30 seconds)
5. Verify: Check database
6. Iterate: Repeat steps 2-5 until correct

**Iteration cost**: 30 seconds per test cycle
**Total time**: 5-10 iterations = 2.5-5 minutes of waiting

**AFTER** (Incremental):
1. Add table to schema.py
2. Extract data in javascript_impl.py
3. Store in node_database.py
4. Test: `aud index --incremental` (2 seconds if only test fixture changed)
5. Verify: Check database
6. Iterate: Repeat steps 2-5 until correct

**Iteration cost**: 2 seconds per test cycle
**Total time**: 5-10 iterations = 10-20 seconds of waiting

**Speedup**: 15x faster iteration on new features

## Risks

### CRITICAL Risks

**Risk 1: Incremental Database Inconsistency**
- **Impact**: HIGH (database gets into "bad state" compounding over runs)
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM (complexity of cross-file dependencies)
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Periodic full rebuild (every 50 incremental updates or 24 hours)
  2. Validation checks after incremental update (no orphaned rows)
  3. `--full` flag always available as safety valve
  4. Feature flag to disable incremental if issues found

**Risk 2: CFG ID Remapping Bugs**
- **Impact**: HIGH (broken CFG edges, corrupted control flow)
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM (AUTOINCREMENT ID handling is complex)
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Comprehensive tests for CFG deletion/reinsertion
  2. Validate cfg_edges still reference valid cfg_blocks
  3. Fallback: Rebuild CFG tables entirely on incremental update

**Risk 3: Cross-File Dependency Tracking Incomplete**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (missed updates when dependencies change)
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM (import graph traversal is complex)
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Conservative approach: Re-index all importers when file changes
  2. Track reverse dependencies in refs table
  3. Full rebuild if dependency tracking fails

### MEDIUM Risks

**Risk 4: File Watching Platform Issues**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (daemon crashes or misses events on some OSs)
- **Likelihood**: LOW (watchdog is mature library)
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Comprehensive testing on Windows/Linux/macOS
  2. Fallback to manual `--incremental` if daemon fails
  3. Auto-restart daemon on crash

**Risk 5: Memory Usage Spike**
- **Impact**: LOW (slightly higher memory for manifest comparison)
- **Likelihood**: LOW (manifest is <10MB for 10K files)
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Stream manifest comparison (don't load entire manifest into RAM)
  2. Profile memory usage in tests

### LOW Risks

**Risk 6: Dependency on Watchdog Library**
- **Impact**: LOW (new dependency, ~500KB)
- **Likelihood**: LOW (watchdog is stable, widely used)
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Make watchdog optional dependency (only for `aud watch`)
  2. Graceful degradation if watchdog not installed

---

## Success Metrics

### Must Pass (Non-Negotiable)

1. ✅ **Correctness**: Incremental result IDENTICAL to full rebuild (same database content)
2. ✅ **Performance**: 15-30x faster for 5 changed files out of 2,000
3. ✅ **Consistency**: Validation checks pass after every incremental update
4. ✅ **Safety**: Full rebuild always available and works correctly
5. ✅ **Backward Compat**: All existing commands work unchanged
6. ✅ **Test Coverage**: 100% existing tests pass + new incremental tests
7. ✅ **No Schema Changes**: All 151 tables remain identical
8. ✅ **AST Extractors Unchanged**: javascript_impl.py, python_impl.py untouched

### Regression Criteria (Any fail = rollback)

1. ❌ Incremental database differs from full rebuild
2. ❌ Performance slower than baseline (no speedup)
3. ❌ Memory usage >2x baseline
4. ❌ Any existing test failures
5. ❌ Database corruption (orphaned rows, broken FKs)
6. ❌ AST extractors modified

---

## Non-Goals

### Out of Scope

1. ❌ Change AST extraction logic (extractors remain sacred)
2. ❌ Modify database schema structure (all tables stay identical)
3. ❌ Optimize indexing algorithms (performance comes from skipping unchanged files)
4. ❌ Add new taint features (pure infrastructure change)
5. ❌ Support partial file updates (granularity is whole files only)

### Explicitly NOT Changing

- AST extractors (javascript_impl.py, python_impl.py)
- Database schema (151 tables)
- Extractor interfaces (BaseExtractor API)
- Storage layer (database manager methods)
- Analysis commands (taint, fce, graph, etc.)
- Public CLI interface (backward compatible)

---

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Points

**After Phase 1 (Hash-Based Incremental)**:
- Feature flag toggle: `THEAUDITOR_INCREMENTAL=0` disables incremental
- Default behavior: Full rebuild (no impact if not using `--incremental`)

**After Phase 2 (File Watching)**:
- `aud watch` is optional command (doesn't affect default workflow)
- Users can simply not run daemon (zero impact)

**After Phase 3 (AI Integration)**:
- Post-edit hook is optional (users can disable in config)

**Emergency Rollback**:
- Full rebuild always available: `aud index --full`
- If incremental corrupts database: delete `.pf/`, run `aud full`
- Revert commit: All incremental code in isolated modules

### Zero Data Loss

- Database schema unchanged (incremental vs full = identical schema)
- Full rebuild always produces correct database
- Manifest system preserves history (`.pf/manifest.previous.json`)

---

## Dependencies

**Required**: NONE (core incremental logic uses stdlib only)

**Optional** (for Phase 2 - File Watching):
- `watchdog` library (~500KB, stable)
- Platform support: Windows/Linux/macOS (all supported by watchdog)

**Blocks**: NONE (parallel to other work)

**Blocked By**: Architect approval

**Synergy**: Unblocks rapid iteration on all future indexing improvements
