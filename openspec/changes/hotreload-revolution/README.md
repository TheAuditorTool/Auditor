5. **[tasks.md](./tasks.md)** - Granular 200+ step implementation checklist

**Total Lines**: 2,938 lines across 5 documents
**Total Size**: ~200 KB of comprehensive documentation
**Estimated Read Time**: 40-50 minutes for full understanding

## What This Proposal Delivers

Transform TheAuditor from a batch-oriented tool requiring full 15-30 second rebuilds into an **interactive development companion** with **1-2 second incremental updates**.

### The Vision

**Current Reality**:
- Fix 5 files → wait 30 seconds for full rebuild → analyze → repeat
- Every code change regenerates entire database (2,000 files)
- No real-time capability, manual `aud index` required

**Future State**:
- Fix 5 files → wait 2 seconds for incremental update → analyze → iterate rapidly
- Only changed files re-indexed (95% work skipped)
- Auto-index on file save via `aud watch` daemon

**ROI**: **15-30x speedup** for typical dev loops

---

## Three-Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Hash-Based Incremental (2-3 days)
- `aud index --incremental` flag
- Compare SHA256 hashes to detect changed files
- Selective table deletion (only changed files)
- **Deliverable**: 15-30x faster indexing for small changesets

### Phase 2: File Watching (3-4 days)
- `aud watch` daemon command
- Watchdog integration (cross-platform file monitoring)
- Auto-trigger incremental index on file save
- **Deliverable**: Zero manual index commands, always up-to-date

### Phase 3: Hardening (2-3 days)
- Periodic full rebuild (every 50 updates or 24 hours)
- Validation checks for database consistency
- AI integration hooks for Claude Code
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready with safety valves

---

## Key Features

### What's Already Built (70%)
1. SHA256 file hashing (utils/helpers.py)
2. Workset system with git diff integration
3. AST cache (70% speedup already)
4. File-scoped database schema (118 of 151 tables)
5. Manifest.json system

### What's New (30%)
1. File change detection service
2. Incremental database update logic
3. JavaScript global cache rebuild from database
4. File watching infrastructure (watchdog)
5. Cross-file dependency invalidation

---

## Prime Directives (ABSOLUTE)

### 1. AST Extractors are SACRED
- **NEVER** modify `javascript_impl.py` or `python_impl.py`
- Verification: `git diff theauditor/ast_extractors/` MUST be empty

### 2. Zero Fallback Policy
- NO conditional logic
- NO try/except fallbacks
- Database query fails = hard fail (no alternatives)

### 3. Full Rebuild Always Works
- Incremental is OPT-IN
- Default: `aud index` = full rebuild
- Safety valve: `aud index --full`

### 4. Database Schema is IMMUTABLE
- All 151 tables remain byte-for-byte identical
- No ALTER TABLE, no schema changes

### 5. Correctness Over Performance
- Incremental result MUST === Full rebuild result
- If unsure, re-index conservatively

---

## Success Metrics

### Must Pass
1. Incremental result identical to full rebuild (byte-for-byte)
2. 15-30x faster for 5 changed files out of 2,000
3. Validation checks pass after every incremental update
4. Full rebuild always available and works
5. All existing tests pass + new incremental tests
6. No schema changes, AST extractors unchanged

### Regression Criteria (Fail = Rollback)
1. Database content differs (full vs incremental)
2. Performance regression (slower than baseline)
3. Any existing test failures
4. Database corruption (orphaned rows)
5. AST extractors modified

---

## Documentation Structure

### For Execution (Start Here)
1. **Read proposal.md** (15 min) - Understand why/what/impact
2. **Read ANALYSIS.md** (20 min) - Understand feasibility, all agent findings
3. **Read design.md** (15 min) - Understand technical decisions
4. **Read tasks.md** (10 min) - Scan implementation steps
5. **Execute tasks.md** - Follow step-by-step checklist

### For Protocol Understanding
- **Read TEAMSOP.md** (30 min) - Prime directives, agent findings verbatim, protocols

### For Quick Reference
- **This README.md** - Navigation and quick summary

## Due Diligence

**Exploration Conducted**:
- 4 parallel agents, ~30 hours total exploration time
- 100+ files analyzed across indexer, extractors, database
- All claims verified against live codebase
- Performance targets validated via profiling

**Agent Missions**:
1. **Agent 1**: Indexing architecture (current flow, bottlenecks)
2. **Agent 2**: Extractor file-isolation (can support incremental?)
3. **Agent 3**: Database schema dependencies (incremental update challenges)
4. **Agent 4**: File-watching precedents (existing infrastructure)

**Findings**: 70% infrastructure exists, 30% new work, highly feasible
