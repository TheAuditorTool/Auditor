### Hypotheses & Verification Results

**Hypothesis 1**: GraphQL resolver params in framework_extractors.js are creating dict objects instead of strings
- **Verification**: ✅ CONFIRMED at framework_extractors.js:529-682
- **Evidence**: `params.map((p, idx) => ({ param_name: p.name, ... }))` creates objects, not strings
- **Impact**: 5,800+ corrupted function_call_args records with param_name as stringified dicts

**Hypothesis 2**: JavaScript ORM extraction lacks deduplication while Python has it
- **Verification**: ✅ CONFIRMED at core_ast_extractors.js:959-1086
- **Evidence**: JavaScript directly pushes to array without dedup check; Python uses `seen_relationships` Set
- **Discrepancy**: Inconsistent implementation between languages despite identical database constraints

**Hypothesis 3**: TypeScript parameter extraction returns nested AST nodes
- **Verification**: ✅ CONFIRMED at typescript_impl.py multiple locations
- **Evidence**: Defensive `isinstance(param_name, dict)` checks with nested unwrapping logic
- **Pattern**: Appears 3+ times suggesting systematic issue, not isolated bug

**Hypothesis 4**: Storage.py has defensive type conversions violating ZERO FALLBACK POLICY
- **Verification**: ✅ CONFIRMED at storage.py:426-437, 1155-1160, 1931-1936
- **Evidence**: Multiple `isinstance()` checks with fallback conversions
- **Violation**: Direct violation of CLAUDE.md ZERO FALLBACK POLICY - should hard fail instead

**Hypothesis 5**: Sequelize doesn't generate bidirectional relationships
- **Verification**: ✅ CONFIRMED at sequelize_extractors.js:69-100
- **Evidence**: Only creates source→target relationships, no inverse generation
- **Discrepancy**: SQLAlchemy/Django create both directions via backref logic

### Discrepancies Found

1. **Architecture Mismatch**: JavaScript extractors return nested objects; Python returns flat dicts
2. **Deduplication Strategy**: Inconsistent between languages - Python has it, JavaScript doesn't
3. **Relationship Logic**: Python creates bidirectional relationships, JavaScript only unidirectional
4. **Error Handling**: Storage layer uses defensive conversions instead of hard failures
5. **Data Types**: No schema contract enforcing return types from extractors

### Root Cause Chain Analysis

1. **Surface Symptom**: Database constraint violations and pipeline crashes
2. **Problem Chain**:
   - GraphQL extractors refactored to return structured params objects
   - Storage layer expects simple strings for param_name field
   - No validation between extraction and storage layers
   - Database is first validation point (too late)
   - Constraint violations crash the pipeline
3. **Actual Root Cause**: No schema contract or validation between extraction and storage layers
4. **Why This Happened**:
   - Design Decision: Dynamic typing without runtime validation
   - Missing Safeguard: No integration tests validating extractor output types

### Evidence Summary

- **Files with dict param_names**: 117+ JavaScript files in test fixtures
- **Affected records**: ~5,800+ function_call_args with malformed data
- **Duplicate ORM relationships**: Unknown count (crashes prevent full indexing)
- **Defensive code locations**: 4+ distinct patterns in storage.py

### Verification Complete

All hypotheses confirmed. Root causes identified. Ready for implementation phase.
