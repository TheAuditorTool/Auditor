## Hypotheses & Evidence

1. The repo index schema has no GitHub Actions tables today.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/indexer/schema.py:905` enumerates every registered table and the list ends with findings without any GitHub-specific entries.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/indexer/database.py:178` starts `create_schema`, and the ensuing `CREATE TABLE` calls cover existing domains (files, sql_objects, compose_services, etc.) with no statements for workflows, jobs, or steps.

2. No extractor is currently responsible for `.github/workflows/*.yml`.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/indexer/extractors/generic.py:77` limits config extraction to compose, nginx, or package manifests; the guard at `theauditor/indexer/extractors/generic.py:91` only matches those patterns.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/indexer/extractors/__init__.py:202` dynamically registers one extractor per module and the directory listing lacks any GitHub-specific module, so workflows are never parsed.

3. The full pipeline never runs a GitHub Actions phase.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/pipelines.py:414` defines `command_order` and contains no command referencing GitHub or workflows.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/pipelines.py:564` buckets commands into foundation/data-prep/parallel/final stages; without a workflow command there is nothing to schedule in any stage.

4. Downstream consumers expect SQLite-backed truth.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/fce.py:52` opens `.pf/repo_index.db` inside `scan_all_findings`, so new workflow intelligence must live in the database to participate in correlation.
   - Evidence: `theauditor/rules/orchestrator.py:110` crawls the `rules/` tree at runtime, meaning a future `rules/github_actions` package will be picked up automatically once data exists.

## Discrepancies & Alignment Notes
- No existing table or JSON artifact records workflow/job/step relationships, so dual-write logic has to be introduced alongside the schema.
- The current pipeline lacks any placeholders for workflow extraction, so we must design both standalone CLI entry points and pipeline integration.

## Conclusion
The current codebase confirms the absence of GitHub Actions modeling across the indexer, pipeline, and rules engines. Any proposal must introduce database schemas, extraction logic, pipeline stages, and rule/FCE integrations while honoring the SQLite-first architecture and courier dual-write conventions.
