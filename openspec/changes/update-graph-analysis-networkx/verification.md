## Hypotheses & Evidence

1. The published architecture states the analyzer already relies on NetworkX.
   - Evidence: `ARCHITECTURE.md:162` explicitly claims “Uses NetworkX for graph algorithms.”

2. The `[project.optional-dependencies]` `all` extra installs NetworkX today.
   - Evidence (refuted): `pyproject.toml:50-78` enumerates the `all` extra without any `networkx` entry.

3. `XGraphAnalyzer.detect_cycles` delegates to NetworkX utilities rather than a hand-rolled DFS.
   - Evidence (refuted): `theauditor/graph/analyzer.py:22-84` implements a manual DFS with `defaultdict`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`; `rg -n "networkx" theauditor/graph/analyzer.py` returns no hits.

4. `aud graph analyze` instantiates a NetworkX-based pipeline when assembling results.
   - Evidence (refuted): `theauditor/commands/graph.py:173-266` imports `XGraphAnalyzer`, calls `detect_cycles`, `calculate_node_degrees`, and `impact_of_change` directly, and never imports NetworkX.

5. User-facing guidance for graph insights matches the actual dependency list.
   - Evidence (refuted): `theauditor/commands/insights.py:127` instructs users to install `pip install -e ".[all]" (networkx)` even though the `all` extra currently omits NetworkX.

## Discrepancies & Alignment Notes
- Documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) and CLI guidance advertise NetworkX usage, yet neither the dependency set nor the analyzer implementation includes it.
- The current analyzer’s custom DFS/degree logic contradicts the documented reliance on NetworkX, leaving us without the documented advanced graph algorithms.

## Conclusion
NetworkX is promised but not actually wired into dependencies, the analyzer, or CLI flows. The new change must add NetworkX to the `all` extra, build graph structures from the SQLite store with NetworkX primitives, and update `aud graph analyze` so the runtime behavior matches the published architecture.
