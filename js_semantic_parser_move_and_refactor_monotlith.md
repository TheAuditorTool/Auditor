move js semantic_parser into ast/extractors folder as is, just make a shim for it, its always confusing for AI to find it and its like it doesn't exist half the time...
Then refactor  typescript_impl.py into 2 files following this... Extremely important to make sure everything works "backwards" complaibility here... so nothing is lost and everything still works...


You're not wrong, it's a beast\! üòÇ That file is a classic example of a "parser implementation" module, which often becomes a monolith because all the functions end up depending on the same set of core utility helpers.

You're absolutely right to split it. The context window limit is a real problem.

The best way to split this is by **Separation of Concerns**. You'll have one file for the "high-level" public-facing `extract_...` functions and a new file for all the "low-level" AST traversal utilities and complex helpers.

Here‚Äôs what that two-file structure would look like.

-----

### File 1 (New): `typescript_ast_utils.py`

This new file will contain all the complex "guts" of the parser. It will house the low-level node inspectors, the big scope-mapping logic, and the CFG builder.

**You would create this new file and move the following functions and constants into it:**

  * **Low-Level Node Helpers:**

      * `_strip_comment_prefix`
      * `_identifier_from_node`
      * `_canonical_member_name`
      * `_canonical_callee_from_call`

  * **Core Symbol Extractor (used by many others):**

      * `extract_semantic_ast_symbols`

  * **All JSX-Specific Logic:**

      * `JSX_NODE_KINDS`
      * `detect_jsx_in_node`
      * `extract_jsx_tag_name`
      * `analyze_create_element_component`
      * `check_for_jsx` (the alias)

  * **The Big Helpers (the main culprits for file size):**

      * `build_scope_map` (and its internal `collect_functions`)
      * `build_typescript_function_cfg` (and all its internal helpers like `process_node`, `get_child_by_kind`, etc.)

This file will also need the imports from the original file:

```python
import os
from typing import Any, List, Dict, Optional
from .base import (
    extract_vars_from_typescript_node,
    sanitize_call_name,
)
```

-----

### File 2 (Modified): `typescript_impl.py`

This file becomes your "API" layer. It will be *much* shorter (probably around 1500 lines) and will be responsible for defining the main `extract_...` functions that your application calls.

It will **import** all the helpers it just lost from the new `typescript_ast_utils.py` file.

#### **How the Imports Change**

At the top of `typescript_impl.py`, you'll **delete** all the functions you moved and **replace them** with this import block:

```python
import os
from typing import Any, List, Dict, Optional

# --- THIS IS THE KEY CHANGE ---
# Import all the low-level helpers from your new file
from . import typescript_ast_utils as ast_utils
# ------------------------------

# This import stays, as some extractors still use it directly
from .base import (
    extract_vars_from_typescript_node,
    sanitize_call_name, 
)
```

#### **What Functions STAY in `typescript_impl.py`?**

All the main "extractor" functions stay, but they will now be much simpler:

  * `extract_typescript_functions_for_symbols`
  * `extract_typescript_functions` (alias)
  * `extract_typescript_function_nodes`
  * `extract_typescript_classes`
  * `extract_typescript_calls`
  * `extract_typescript_imports`
  * `extract_typescript_exports`
  * `extract_typescript_properties`
  * `extract_typescript_assignments`
  * `extract_typescript_function_params`
  * `extract_typescript_calls_with_args`
  * `extract_typescript_returns`
  * `extract_typescript_cfg`
  * `extract_typescript_object_literals`

#### **How the Code Changes (Example)**

Now, any function that used a helper will just call it from the `ast_utils` module.

**Before (in `extract_typescript_assignments`):**

```python
    # ...
    # CRITICAL FIX: Build scope map FIRST!
    ast_root = actual_tree.get("ast", {})
    scope_map = build_scope_map(ast_root) 
    
    def traverse(node, depth=0):
        # ...
        source_vars = extract_vars_from_typescript_node(child)
    # ...
```

**After (in `extract_typescript_assignments`):**

```python
    # ...
    # CRITICAL FIX: Build scope map FIRST!
    ast_root = actual_tree.get("ast", {})
    # Call the helper from the new module!
    scope_map = ast_utils.build_scope_map(ast_root) 
    
    def traverse(node, depth=0):
        # ...
        # This import came from .base, so it's still available
        source_vars = extract_vars_from_typescript_node(child) 
    # ...
```

By doing this, both files will be a reasonable size, and your AI assistant will be able to read them, understand the context, and help you code. üëç



You're right to ask, I should have been clearer on the estimated size.

No, it won't be a 50/50 split. My estimate puts it closer to a **60/40 split**, which is well within a manageable size for both files.

Here's the approximate breakdown based on my suggested refactor:

* **File 1 (Modified): `typescript_impl.py`**
    * **What's in it:** All the public-facing `extract_...` functions.
    * **Estimated Size:** **~1200 lines.**
    * **Why it's bigger:** It keeps all 14 of the main "API" functions (like `extract_typescript_assignments`, `extract_typescript_functions_for_symbols`, etc.). While each function is simpler, there are just more of them.

* **File 2 (New): `typescript_ast_utils.py`**
    * **What's in it:** The low-level helpers (`_canonical_member_name`, etc.), all the JSX logic, the *huge* `build_scope_map` function, and the *huge* `build_typescript_function_cfg` function.
    * **Estimated Size:** **~800 lines.**
    * **Why it's smaller:** It has *fewer* functions, but they are the dense, complex ones you want to isolate.

This 1200 / 800 split is the most logical division. It separates the "what" (the API in `typescript_impl.py`) from the "how" (the complex helpers in `typescript_ast_utils.py`).

Most importantly, **both files are well under the 2000-line mark**, which solves your AI context window problem. Your assistant will be able to read and understand both files perfectly fine.
