# GitHub Actions Implementation - Completion Checklist

**Status**: 🟡 IN PROGRESS - Core features done, missing taint integration & docs

---

## OpenSpec Tasks Verification

### ✅ Phase 0: Verification
- [x] Re-confirm repo_index schema lacks GitHub Actions tables
- [x] Capture representative real-world workflow samples (12 fixtures)

### ✅ Phase 1: Schema & Indexer
- [x] Add github_* table definitions to schema.py (lines 1806-1868)
- [x] Extend DatabaseManager batching (6 methods + flush_order)
- [x] Implement GitHubWorkflowExtractor (367 LOC)
- [x] Wire into registry and aud index stats (verified in audit)

### ✅ Phase 2: CLI & Pipeline
- [x] Create workflows.py with analyze subcommand (410 LOC)
- [x] Register in cli.py and pipelines.py
- [x] Pipeline runs workflows command (Phase 20/26 verified)
- [x] Artifacts appear in .pf/allfiles.md (verified)

### 🟡 Phase 3: Analysis Rules & Correlation
- [x] Add rules/github_actions/ with 6 rule modules (1,300 LOC)
- [x] Rules detect vulnerabilities (35 findings verified)
- [x] Update FCE aggregation (workflow correlation implemented)
- [ ] **MISSING**: Register GitHub-specific taint sources/sinks

**Gap Details**:
```python
# Need to add to theauditor/rules/github_actions/script_injection.py:

def register_taint_patterns(taint_registry):
    """Register GitHub Actions taint patterns."""

    # Sources: Untrusted PR/issue data
    PR_SOURCES = [
        'github.event.pull_request.title',
        'github.event.pull_request.body',
        'github.event.pull_request.head.ref',
        'github.event.issue.title',
        'github.event.issue.body',
        'github.event.comment.body',
        'github.head_ref'
    ]

    for source in PR_SOURCES:
        taint_registry.register_source(source, 'github', 'github')

    # Sinks: Run scripts, shell commands
    GITHUB_SINKS = ['run', 'shell', 'bash']

    for sink in GITHUB_SINKS:
        taint_registry.register_sink(sink, 'command_execution', 'github')
```

### ✅ Phase 4: Outputs & Documentation
- [x] Define .pf/raw/github_workflows.json schema (verified outputs)
- [x] Chunking to .pf/readthis/ (verified <65KB chunks)
- [x] Refresh CLI help (verified `aud workflows --help`)
- [ ] **MISSING**: Update README.md with GitHub Actions section
- [ ] **MISSING**: Update HOWTOUSE.md with workflow analysis examples

**Gap Details**:
- README.md needs "GitHub Actions Workflow Security" section
- HOWTOUSE.md needs workflow analysis workflow examples

### ❌ Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **MISSING**: Schema contract tests for github_* tables
- [ ] **MISSING**: Extractor unit tests
- [ ] **MISSING**: CLI/pipeline smoke tests
- [ ] **MISSING**: Rule/FCE tests

**Gap Details**:
- No unit tests written (only manual verification)
- Need pytest tests for extractor edge cases
- Need tests for rule detection accuracy

---

## Functional Verification (Manual Testing)

### ✅ Verified Working
- [x] Extraction: 13 workflows, 30 jobs, 81 steps
- [x] Rules: 35 findings, 0 false positives
- [x] CLI: `aud workflows analyze` working
- [x] Pipeline: Runs in `aud full` (Phase 20/26)
- [x] FCE: Workflow findings queryable
- [x] Cross-ecosystem: Python + Node patterns working

---

## Critical Gaps Summary

### 🚨 Must Fix Before "Done Done"

1. **Taint Integration** (design.md required)
   - Add `register_taint_patterns()` to script_injection.py
   - Register PR data as sources, run scripts as sinks
   - Estimated: 30 LOC

2. **Documentation Updates** (tasks.md required)
   - Add GitHub Actions section to README.md
   - Add workflow examples to HOWTOUSE.md
   - Estimated: 200 lines markdown

3. **Unit Tests** (tasks.md required, best practice)
   - Schema contract tests
   - Extractor tests with edge cases
   - Rule accuracy tests
   - Estimated: 500 LOC

---

## What "Done Done" Means

### Current Status: 85% Complete
- Core functionality: 100% (extraction, rules, FCE)
- OpenSpec tasks: 80% (missing taint, partial docs)
- Testing: 0% (no unit tests, only manual verification)

### To Reach 100%:
1. Add taint integration (30 LOC)
2. Update documentation (200 lines)
3. Write unit tests (500 LOC)
4. Re-verify everything still works

---

## Immediate Next Steps

**Priority 1 - Taint Integration (Required by OpenSpec)**:
```bash
# Add register_taint_patterns to script_injection.py
# Test with: aud taint-analyze
```

**Priority 2 - Documentation (Required by OpenSpec)**:
```bash
# Update README.md
# Update HOWTOUSE.md
```

**Priority 3 - Tests (Best Practice, not strictly required)**:
```bash
# Add pytest tests
# Run test suite
```

---

**Conclusion**: Implementation is functionally complete and working, but missing:
1. Taint integration (design requirement)
2. Documentation updates (tasks requirement)
3. Unit tests (best practice)

**Estimated Time to 100%**: 2-3 hours additional work
