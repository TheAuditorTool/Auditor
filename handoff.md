## Unified Handoff (2025-10-20 @ 01:15 UTC)

### The Moon (Target Condition)
- Deterministic multi-hop taint analysis for Plant: controller → service → ORM sinks (SQL/Prisma/Sequelize) without manual hints.
- Cross-file provenance must survive Stage 2 (flow-insensitive) and Stage 3 (CFG) with zero undocumented fallbacks.
- Indexer continues to own data production (tsconfig discovery, AST batching). Parsers parse, extractors extract, taint engine only consumes verified database facts.

### Historical Timeline (condensed)
- **Bug 1–8**: Crashes, missing canonical names, and grouping errors resolved in earlier refactors (`verifiy/summary.md`).  
- **Bug 9**: `get_containing_function()` returned normalized names (`asyncHandler_arg0`) – fixed by sourcing canonical names from `symbols`.  
- **Bug 10**: Legacy propagation fallback removed per CLAUDE.md.  
- **Bug 11**: Stage 3 processed each `function_call_args` row independently, preventing callee traversal. Grouping arguments by call site unlocked multi-hop Stage 3.  
- Obsolete blueprint `verifiy/multihopcrosspath_obsolete.txt` relied on forbidden heuristics; do **not** resurrect it.

### Summary of Work Completed (current session)
1. **Taint result consolidation** (`taint/core.py`, `taint/propagation.py`)  
   - `TaintPath` tracks `related_sources`, so a single sink entry now aggregates every controller that feeds it.  
   - Dedup executes in two passes: keep the highest-scoring source/sink path, then collapse by sink line and attach provenance metadata. Output shrank from 214 rows (52 duplicate sinks) to **97 unique findings**.

2. **Stage 2 identifier preservation** (`taint/interprocedural.py` – flow-insensitive)  
   - Propagation now recognises simple identifiers (e.g. `data`, `createdBy`) even when TypeScript definitions expose generic parameters (`req`, `res`, `arg0`).  
   - Non-null assertions are normalised (`userId!` → `userId`), and bare identifiers harvested from argument expressions keep cross-file resolution stable.

3. **Stage 3 callback + alias traversal** (`taint/interprocedural.py` – CFG)  
   - Canonical callee names are resolved before invoking the CFG analyzer – `BaseService.create` is inspected instead of the TS alias.  
   - Generic parameters are rewritten to concrete identifiers by backtracking through assignments (`createData` → `data`).  
   - Inline callbacks (e.g. `runWithTenant_arg1`) are enqueued via `cfg_callback` worklist entries so captured closures are analysed; outer tainted vars are threaded into the closure scope.  
   - Argument aliasing now uses DB facts only (assignments, call arguments) – no regex hacks.

4. **Validation / Observability**  
   - `aud taint-analyze --json --no-rules` (latest run 2025-10-20 04:50 UTC) produced **133 findings**; BaseService create/update/bulkCreate/findOne now report with CFG provenance.  
   - Debug traces stored at `C:\Users\santa\area_trace_debug.txt` capture Stage 3 traversal through `TenantContext.runWithTenant` and identify remaining gaps.  
5. **Stage 3 serialization & return propagation**  
   - Stage 3 paths now mark `flow_sensitive=True`, and `_query_path_taint_status()` records `__return__` whenever a return statement references a tainted identifier (Stage 3 now understands `record` in `BaseService.findById`/`create`).  
6. **Extractor / propagation hardening**  
   - JS helper now preserves `ReturnStatement.expression` in the serialized AST, restoring TypeScript `return_vars` extraction without hand-rolled per-project hacks.  
   - Added identifier-base seeding (`req` alongside `req.body`) so cross-file propagation spends its last hop at BaseService sinks instead of a service controller alias.  
7. **Zero fallback policy enforced**  
   - Stage 3 “simple-check” fallback removed; any PathAnalyzer failure now surfaces immediately (per CLAUDE.md).  
   - Added `destroy` to `SECURITY_SINKS["sql"]` so destructive ORM calls register as first-class sinks.
8. **Prefix seeding for dotted sources** (`taint/propagation.py`)  
   - Stage 2 now emits hierarchical prefixes (e.g., `req`, `req.params`) for dotted identifiers so Stage 3 can map controller arguments like `req.params.id` through service wrappers into BaseService sinks.  
   - Verified via targeted DB queries that `AreaController.delete` now exposes both prefixes, enabling the `areaService.deleteArea` hop to receive tainted `areaId`.

### Current System Snapshot

| Concern | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Indexer | `ast_parser.py` + JS helper templates | Semantic batching stable; zero helper fallbacks; DB regeneration clean. |
| Extractors | unchanged | `assignments`, `function_call_args`, `function_returns`, `variable_usage` populated without schema tweaks. |
| Taint Stage 2 | `interprocedural.py` | Cross-file propagation uses canonical names, preserves origin metadata, handles TypeScript identifiers. |
| Taint Stage 3 | `interprocedural.py` + `cfg_integration.py` | Multi-hop traversal with callback awareness and sink dedupe; `flow_sensitive` now set on CFG-backed paths and BaseService ORM sinks surface with related provenance. |
| Memory Cache | unchanged | Preload consumes ≈45.8 MB; no regression observed. |

#### Latest Plant Run (2025-10-20 04:50 UTC)
- Command: `aud taint-analyze --json --no-rules`.  
- Stats: 306 sources, 1 101 sinks, **133 flows** (new finding: `record.destroy` at `BaseService.delete`).  
- Example Stage 3 path with callback hop:  
  ```
  backend/src/controllers/account.controller.ts:34 (AccountController.create)
    cfg_callback → backend/src/controllers/account.controller.ts:38 (asyncHandler_arg0)
    cfg_call     → backend/src/services/account.service.ts:34 (AccountService.createAccount)
    intra_procedural_flow → backend/src/services/account.service.ts:93 (Account.create)
  ```
- `.pf/raw/taint_analysis.json` now contains `related_sources` and `related_source_count` per sink.
- CFG hop distribution: 45 flows with 1 hop, 8 with 2 hops, 2 with 3 hops, 2 with 4 hops, and **2 with 5 hops** (deep sequelize query chains).

**Key Metrics**  
- `function_call_args`: 13 248 total / 11 549 with `callee_file_path`. Remaining 1 699 nulls correspond to legacy Sequelize migrations.  
- `orm_queries`: 736 rows. BaseService, Account, Task, WorkerAssignment flows appear; `record.destroy` now emits a CFG-confirmed path from `DestructionController.delete`.  
- Debug logs: `area_trace_debug.txt` (stored in user profile) captures Stage 3 decision points for closure traversal.

### Guiding Constraints (`CLAUDE.md` recap)
- **Zero fallback policy**: No “simple check” or heuristic fallbacks are allowed. Stage 3 now raises immediately on `PathAnalyzer` failure—keep it strictly database-driven.  
- **No project-specific mapping**: Enhancements must derive from AST/DB facts (assignments, `function_call_args`, `orm_queries`). No Plant-only identifiers or hard-coded sink lists.  
- **Cache-first queries**: `taint/memory_cache.py` owns CFG/graph data; future work should keep routing lookups through the cache to respect the performance contract.

### Immediate TODOs / Next Work Package

1. **Surface non-BaseService delete flows** *(PRIMARY NEXT TASK)*  
   - Context: `record.destroy` (BaseService.delete) now reports with CFG evidence. Domain-specific services (e.g., `DestructionService.recordDestruction`, `HarvestService.delete`) wrap deletions and currently yield Stage 2-only findings (`destructionService.delete`).  
   - Goal: Capture their ORM calls in semantic extraction/DB tables and seed the right identifiers so Stage 3 can traverse controller → wrapper → ORM sink.  
   - Next-session checklist:
     1. Inspect each wrapper to document the concrete ORM call (Sequelize, Prisma, raw SQL).  
     2. Confirm the extractor emits the call (and return value) into `function_call_args`/`orm_queries`/`function_returns`; enhance `typescript_impl` if any fields are missing.  
     3. With prefix seeding live, verify which wrappers still emit Stage 2-only findings; adjust propagation for remaining alias shapes (e.g., destructured params) as needed.  
     4. Re-run `aud taint-analyze --json --no-rules`; verify new CFG paths exist in `.pf/raw/taint_analysis.json` and capture sample multi-hop traces.  
     5. Log any stubborn wrappers (file/line + reason) for follow-up.

2. **Audit remaining Stage 2-only findings** *(SECONDARY BACKLOG)*  
   - 62 flows still report zero CFG hops (mostly same-function direct-use paths such as `res.send`). After the delete-wrapper work, spot-check the top offenders to ensure they are legitimate Stage 2 cases rather than missing CFG data.

- **Optional hardening**  
   - Populate `callee_file_path` for migration helpers when time allows.  
   - Consider summarising `related_sources` (counts per controller) for human-facing reports once core coverage is stable.

### File Guide (Separation of Concerns)
- `theauditor/ast_extractors/js_helper_templates.py`: TypeScript helper skeletons (semantic batching, JS support toggles).  
- `theauditor/js_semantic_parser.py`: Orchestrates helper scripts (unchanged this pass).  
- `theauditor/taint/interprocedural.py`: Stage 2/3 worklist logic; now handles identifier aliasing, callback traversal, canonical callee resolution.  
- `theauditor/taint/propagation.py`: Stage coordination + dedupe (sink-level aggregation).  
- `theauditor/taint/core.py`: `TaintPath` definition + serialization for JSON outputs.  
- `C:\Users\santa\area_trace_debug.txt`: Most recent Stage 3 debug trace for Plant (kept for reference; delete once no longer needed).

### Verification Checklist (latest)
- ✅ `aud taint-analyze --json --no-rules` (2025-10-20 04:50 UTC).  
- ✅ Manual `trace_from_source(..., use_cfg=True)` probes for `AreaController.create` (debug logs attached).  
- ✅ SQLite sanity checks on `function_call_args`, `assignments`, and `cfg_blocks` to confirm alias propagation.  
- ⚠️ Outstanding: automated regression query for BaseService coverage (blocked until sinks surface).

### Backlog / Known Areas for Enhancement
- **Delete flow propagation**: ensure controller → service → `record.destroy` chains keep taint (likely needs bespoke-service alias coverage).  
- **Captured variable seeding**: propagate taint into closure bodies even when no explicit argument carries the tainted value. *(Implemented for BaseService; extend to other helper patterns as needed.)*  
- **Migration call resolution**: annotate legacy Sequelize helpers with `callee_file_path` if we ever target migration taint.  
- **Safe sink tuning**: revisit `res.json()` filtering once multi-hop pipeline is fully stable.  
- **Dynamic dispatch coverage**: still limited; relies on existing object-literal extraction.  
- **Handler extraction gap** (“THE GAP”): direct property arrow assignments remain unindexed until the indexer is enhanced.

This handoff supersedes previous notes; future engineers can pick up at the BaseService callback work without re-triaging the indexer or duplicate-sink issues.
