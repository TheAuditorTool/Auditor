## Documents to UPDATE

### HIGH PRIORITY

```
proposal.md
  From: Pre-implementation plan (tasks unchecked)
  To:   Completion report (tasks checked)
  Changes:
    - Line 9: Change "Status: Proposed" → "Status: Implemented"
    - Line 292-341: Update task checklist - check off completed tasks
    - Line 440-455: Update success metrics with actual values
    - Appendix B: Update table counts (34→59, 79→75+)
  Time: 1-2 hours

STATUS.md
  From: Status report with inconsistencies
  To:   Accurate status with root cause analysis
  Changes:
    - Line 24: Explain UNIQUE constraint fix OR mark as still failing
    - Line 213: Recalculate task completion (should be ~80%, not 68%)
    - Add new section: "Flask Route Test Failure - Root Cause Analysis"
    - Separate "Code Implemented" from "Verified Working"
  Time: 1 hour

tasks.md
  From: Task list with misleading status
  To:   Task list with two states (Code/Verified)
  Changes:
    - Create new task format showing code status vs test status
    - Line 101-108: Explain Flask test failure for Task 9
    - Clarify completion criteria (code only vs code+test)
    - Update task counts (28/41 should be ~32/41 code, ~20/41 verified)
  Time: 1-2 hours

README.md
  From: Overview missing current progress
  To:   Overview including current progress
  Changes:
    - Add section after line 11: "ACTUAL STATUS (As of Nov 1, 2025)"
    - Line 71: Change "TO BE ADDED" → "ADDED"
    - Add link to ACTUAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md
    - Update first action to read STATUS.md instead of proposal.md
  Time: 30 minutes
```

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

```
IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
  From: Step-by-step implementation guide
  To:   Reference guide for modifying extractors
  Changes:
    - Rename to IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md
    - Rewrite intro: "For adding or modifying extractors"
    - Update examples to point to actual code
    - Keep structure but note it's for future maintenance
  Time: 30 minutes

ACTUAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  From: Good status document
  To:   Primary reference with root cause analysis
  Changes:
    - Add section: "Flask Route Test Failure - Root Cause"
    - Add section: "Verification Results"
    - Promote to be the main STATUS reference
    - Link from other docs to this as primary source
  Time: 30 minutes
```

## Documents to KEEP (No changes)

```
design.md
  - All 10 design decisions still valid
  - No contradictions found
  - Just keep it

PHASE3_FILE_OWNERSHIP_REPORT.md
  - Accurate record of what was committed
  - Good for historical reference
  - Keep as-is

spec.md (after review)
  - Haven't fully reviewed yet
  - But appears valid
  - Keep pending review
```

## Documents to PROMOTE

```
ACTUAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  - Currently buried in openspec folder
  - Most accurate description of what's done
  - Should be primary reference for "what's the status?"
  - Consider linking to from proposal/README/STATUS
```

## Critical Issue: Flask Route Test Failure

```
Test: test_flask_routes_extracted
Expected: 6 routes found
Actual: 0 routes found
Severity: CRITICAL - blocks Flask Block 1 validation
Root Cause: UNKNOWN

Possible causes:
  1. Extractor not finding routes
  2. Routes not being stored in database
  3. Routes stored in wrong table
  4. Query in test is wrong

Investigate:
  1. Check flask_extractors.py:extract_flask_request_hooks()
  2. Check if routes being stored (query DB)
  3. Check test query (what table is it looking in?)
  4. Run extractor directly on fixture file

Fix required before:
  - Marking Flask block complete
  - Considering Phase 3 done
  - Updating proposal.md
```
