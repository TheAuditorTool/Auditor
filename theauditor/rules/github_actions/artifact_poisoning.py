"""GitHub Actions Artifact Poisoning Detection.

Detects artifact poisoning vulnerabilities where build artifacts are created in
untrusted contexts (pull_request_target, untrusted jobs) and then consumed/deployed
in trusted contexts without validation.

Attack Pattern:
1. Job A: Builds artifact in pull_request_target context (attacker code)
2. Job A: Uploads artifact via actions/upload-artifact
3. Job B: Downloads artifact via actions/download-artifact (trusted context)
4. Job B: Deploys or signs artifact without validation
5. Result: Attacker artifacts deployed to production or signed with trusted key
