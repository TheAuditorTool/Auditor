"""Detect severely outdated dependencies using existing version check data.

This rule detects dependencies that are 2+ major versions behind latest by reading
the deps_latest.json file created by 'aud deps --check-latest'.

ARCHITECTURE NOTE: This is a HYBRID APPROACH (database + file I/O) by design:
- Database-first: Validates packages against package_configs table
- File I/O: Reads pre-computed version comparison data from .pf/raw/deps_latest.json
- Rationale: Version checking requires network calls (npm/PyPI API), which are slow
  and should only run on-demand via 'aud deps --check-latest', not every pattern scan

Workflow Integration:
1. User runs: aud deps --check-latest (creates .pf/raw/deps_latest.json)
2. User runs: aud detect-patterns (this rule reads the JSON file)
3. Rule reports packages that are severely outdated (2+ major versions behind)

Database Tables Used:
- package_configs: Current dependency versions (for validation)
- Reads: .pf/raw/deps_latest.json (if it exists)
