# Rules Refactoring Progress - Schema Normalization

**Version**: 1.0
**Branch**: pythonparity
**Started**: 2025-10-30
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30

---

## CURRENT STATUS: IN PROGRESS

**Files Audited**: 56/56
**Files Fixed**: 47/56 (auth + build + frameworks + logic + node + orm + performance + python + react + secrets + security + sql + terraform + typescript + vue folders COMPLETE, xss/ 3/6 done)
**Files In Progress**: 1/56 (xss/ folder: dom_xss + express_xss + react_xss COMPLETE, continuing...)
**Files Clean**: 14/56 (includes 10 dependency + 3 deployment + 1 terraform files already clean)
**Progress**: 100% complete (56/56 audited) - LAST FOLDER IN PROGRESS (xss/ 3/6 = 50%)!

### Issue Discovered
ALL rules are infected with `LIKE '%pattern%'` cancer in WHERE clauses. The first file checked (jwt_analyze.py) has 50+ instances of this anti-pattern. Estimated 500-1000+ instances across all 56 files.

---

## THE PROBLEM

### What We're Fixing
Moving from string pattern matching in SQL queries to proper database queries with Python-side filtering.

### Bad Pattern (EVERYWHERE):
```python
# CANCER - String matching in SQL WHERE clause
query = build_query('function_call_args', ['file', 'line', 'argument_expr'],
    where="""callee_function = 'jwt.sign'
        AND argument_expr NOT LIKE '%process.env%'    # BAD
        AND argument_expr LIKE '%secret%'             # BAD
        AND file NOT LIKE '%test%'                    # BAD
        AND file NOT LIKE '%spec.%'""")               # BAD
```

### Good Pattern (TARGET):
```python
# CORRECT - Exact match in SQL, pattern filter in Python
query = build_query('function_call_args', ['file', 'line', 'argument_expr'],
    where="callee_function = 'jwt.sign'")
cursor.execute(query)

for file, line, arg_expr in cursor.fetchall():
    # Filter in Python after fetch
    if 'process.env' in arg_expr:
        continue  # Skip env vars
    if 'secret' not in arg_expr:
        continue  # Need 'secret' keyword
    # ... rest of logic
```

### File Filtering
```python
# BAD - File filtering in every SQL query
where="... AND file NOT LIKE '%test%' AND file NOT LIKE '%spec.%'"

# GOOD - File filtering via METADATA (orchestrator handles)
METADATA = RuleMetadata(
    exclude_patterns=['test/', 'spec.', '__tests__']
)
```

## REFACTORING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Audit (1/56 complete)
1. Read file completely
2. Count LIKE clauses
3. Identify pattern types:
   - File filtering (`file NOT LIKE`)
   - Expression matching (`argument_expr LIKE`)
   - Function name matching (`callee_function LIKE`)
4. Document issues in this file
5. Move to next file

### Phase 2: Fix (0/56 complete)
1. Remove ALL `file NOT LIKE` clauses (orchestrator handles via METADATA)
2. Replace expression LIKE patterns with Python filtering
3. Replace function name LIKE with exact matches or IN clause
4. Test on plant/.pf database
5. Verify findings still work

### Phase 3: Verify (0/56 complete)
1. Run `aud index` on plant project
2. Run specific rule
3. Compare findings before/after
4. Check for regressions in .pf/history

## FILE-BY-FILE PROGRESS

### auth/jwt_analyze.py - FIXED ✅

**Status**: CLEAN - All LIKE cancer removed
**Original LIKE Count**: 50+ instances → **Fixed: 0 instances**
**Lines**: 575 total (was 635)

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **File filtering** - REMOVED all `file NOT LIKE` clauses (10+ instances)
   - Moved to METADATA exclude_patterns: ['test/', 'spec.', '.test.', '__tests__', 'demo/', 'example/']
   - Added execution_scope='database' to METADATA
   - Orchestrator now handles file filtering

2. **Expression pattern matching** - Moved to Python filtering (20+ instances)
   - Lines 192-206: `if any(env in secret_expr for env in ENV_PATTERNS)` instead of LIKE
   - Lines 229-247: Python loop with `if weak in secret_lower`
   - Lines 378-396: Python loop checking `if field.lower() in payload_lower`
   - Lines 407-424: Python filtering for env variables

3. **Function name wildcards** - Frozenset + Python filtering (5+ instances)
   - Created STORAGE_FUNCTIONS and HTTP_FUNCTIONS frozensets
   - Lines 437-455: `if not any(storage in func for storage in STORAGE_FUNCTIONS)`
   - Lines 523-539: `if not any(http_func in func for http_func in HTTP_FUNCTIONS)`
   - All queries use clean WHERE clauses, filter in Python

4. **Assignment filtering** - Python-side pattern matching
   - Lines 465-479: Fetch all assignments, filter with `if any(pattern in source for pattern in url_patterns)`
   - Lines 549-570: File extension check in Python, React hooks check in Python
   - Zero SQL LIKE patterns for any assignments

**Key Changes**:
- WHERE clauses now only use exact matches: `callee_function = 'jwt.sign'` or `argument_index IN (1, 2)`
- All pattern matching moved to Python with frozensets for O(1) lookups
- File now 60 lines shorter due to removed redundant LIKE clauses
- Zero performance impact (fetch is already filtered by frozenset function names)

**Testing Status**: Not tested yet
**Verified Clean**: YES - grep confirms 0 LIKE instances in WHERE clauses

   - Lines 399-413: Token param check with Python list
   - Lines 416-430: Implicit flow check with Python conditions
   - Fetch all assignments once, filter multiple ways

**Key Changes**:
- WHERE clauses now minimal: `method IN ('GET', 'POST')` or `file = ?`
- All pattern matching moved to Python with frozensets
- File 58 lines shorter due to removed LIKE clauses
- Fetches are broader but filtered efficiently in Python

## ZERO FALLBACK POLICY (UNCHANGED)

This refactoring does NOT affect:
- ✅ No table existence checks
- ✅ No fallback queries
- ✅ No JSON fallbacks
- ✅ Hard failure on missing data

We're ONLY fixing the LIKE pattern cancer in WHERE clauses.

---

## TESTING CHECKLIST (Per File)

After fixing each file:

1. **Syntax Check**
   ```bash
   python -m compileall theauditor/rules/auth/jwt_analyze.py
   ```

2. **Database Test** (if plant/.pf exists)
   ```bash
   cd C:/Users/santa/Desktop/plant
   .venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "
   from theauditor.rules.auth.jwt_analyze import find_jwt_flaws
   from theauditor.rules.base import StandardRuleContext
   ctx = StandardRuleContext(
       file_path=None,
       content='',
       language='javascript',
       project_path='.',
       db_path='C:/Users/santa/Desktop/plant/.pf/repo_index.db'
   )
   findings = find_jwt_flaws(ctx)
   print(f'Found {len(findings)} issues')
   "
   ```

3. **Regression Check** (if .pf/history exists)
   ```bash
   aud full --offline  # Creates timestamped backup
   # Compare findings before/after in .pf/history/
   ```

- **common/ folder**: 2/2 files SKIPPED (utility module, no DB queries)
- **dependency/ folder**: 10/10 files ALREADY CLEAN ✅
  - All 10 files already use proper patterns (frozensets, json.loads, no LIKE)
  - No refactoring needed - previous work already complete
- Total LIKE instances removed: 180+
- Status: 15/56 files audited, 5 fixed, 10 already clean (26.8%)

**Patterns Established**:
- Frozensets for O(1) pattern matching
- Fetch-once-filter-multiple for large tables
- Python-side filtering replaces ALL LIKE clauses
- METADATA exclude_patterns replaces file filtering in WHERE
- Raw SQL removal (DISTINCT, complex joins → Python filtering)
- json.loads() for JSON columns is correct (not a refactor target)

**Next Steps**:
1. Move to deployment/ folder (3 files)
2. Continue alphabetically through remaining folders

### 2025-10-30 Session 2 (XSS Folder - Part 1)
- **xss/ folder**: 3/6 files FIXED ✅ (50% complete)
  - FIXED dom_xss_analyze.py (99 LIKE → 0, 712 lines)
    - 7 detection functions refactored
    - Added 3 frozensets: EVENT_HANDLERS, TEMPLATE_LIBRARIES, EVAL_SINKS
    - DOM XSS sources/sinks, URL manipulation, event handlers, DOM clobbering
    - Client-side templates, web messaging, DOMPurify bypass patterns
  - FIXED express_xss_analyze.py (25 LIKE → 0, 438 lines)
    - 6 detection functions refactored
    - Express.js-specific XSS patterns
    - res.send HTML, middleware injection, cookie/header injection, JSONP
  - FIXED react_xss_analyze.py (40 LIKE → 0, 597 lines)
    - 7 detection functions refactored
    - React-specific XSS patterns
    - dangerouslySetInnerHTML, JavaScript URLs, ref manipulation
    - Component injection, SSR vulnerabilities
- Total LIKE instances removed this session: 164
- Total LIKE instances removed project-wide: 1100+ (estimated)
- Status: 47/56 files fixed (83.9%), 3 files remaining in xss/ folder
- All files verified with `python -m py_compile` - no compilation errors

**Key Refactoring Patterns Used**:
- Fetch broader result sets, filter in Python with string operations
- Pattern lists for O(1) lookups: `any(pattern in string for pattern in patterns)`
- Multi-pass filtering: fetch once, apply multiple Python filters
- Frozensets for reusable pattern matching
- Zero LIKE patterns in WHERE clauses (100% compliance)

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete xss/ folder (3 files remaining: template_xss, vue_xss, xss)
2. Project completion: 9 files remaining total (3 xss + 6 already clean)

## ONBOARDING NOTES

### For New Sessions
1. Read this file first
2. Check "CURRENT STATUS" section
3. Find file marked "IN PROGRESS"
4. Read that file's issues section
5. Start fixing

### File Naming Convention
- `*_analyze.py` = Rule files to fix
- `*_analyzer.py` = Old backups (skip these)
- `__init__.py` = Skip

### Key Files
- `theauditor/rules/base.py` - StandardRuleContext, StandardFinding
- `theauditor/indexer/schema.py` - build_query() function
- `TEMPLATE_STANDARD_RULE.py` - Reference template (may need updating)

---

## ESTIMATED TIMELINE

- **Audit Phase**: 1-2 days (56 files × 5 min/file = 5 hours)
- **Fix Phase**: 5-10 days (56 files × 1-2 hours/file = 56-112 hours)
- **Test Phase**: 2-3 days (integration testing)

**Total**: 8-15 days of focused work

---

## HANDOFF CHECKLIST

When handing off to another session:
- [ ] Update "Last Updated" date at top
- [ ] Update current file status (IN PROGRESS → FIXED)
- [ ] Add session log entry
- [ ] Mark next file as IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Commit progress.md changes

---

## KNOWN GOOD PATTERNS

### Frozenset for Function Matching
```python
JWT_FUNCTIONS = frozenset(['jwt.sign', 'jsonwebtoken.sign'])
conditions = ' OR '.join([f"callee_function = '{f}'" for f in JWT_FUNCTIONS])
where = f"({conditions})"
```

### Python-Side Filtering
```python
for file, line, expr in cursor.fetchall():
    if 'test' in file or 'spec' in file:
        continue
    if 'process.env' in expr:
        continue
    # Process finding
```

### JSON Column Parsing (OK)
```python
# This is CORRECT - parsing JSON from DB column
deps_json = row[0]
deps = json.loads(deps_json)
```
