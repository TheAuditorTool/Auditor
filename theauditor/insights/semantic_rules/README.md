# Semantic Context Rules (aud context)

Use this directory to define **semantic context YAML files** for `aud context`. These files teach TheAuditor how to classify existing findings (from `aud detect-patterns` / `aud full`) according to **your** business logic so the tool can keep being a truth courier without guessing.

## Quick Start

1. **Generate findings**  
   Run `aud full` (recommended) or `aud detect-patterns` so `.pf/repo_index.db` + `findings_consolidated` exist.

2. **Copy the template**  
   ```
   cd theauditor/insights/semantic_rules
   cp refactoring.yaml my_security_context.yaml
   ```

3. **Customize**  
   Edit the YAML’s `patterns` to describe which findings are obsolete, current, or transitional. Use the comments inside `refactoring.yaml` (OAuth/JWT example) as guidance.

4. **Run aud context**  
   ```
   aud context --file theauditor/insights/semantic_rules/my_security_context.yaml
   # optional extras
   aud context --file ... --verbose
   aud context --file ... --output semantic_report.json
   ```

5. **Consume the facts**  
   The report shows ❌ obsolete (de‑prioritized), ✅ current (still critical), ⏳ transitional (allowed until date), and ⚠️ mixed files.

## What’s in this folder

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `refactoring.yaml` | End-to-end **security migration** example (JWT → OAuth2). Demonstrates obsolete/current/transitional patterns, scopes, relationships, metadata. Copy/modify for your context. |
| `templates_instructions.md` | Extensive format reference: field descriptions, regex tips, scoping rules, severity guidance, troubleshooting. |

> **Important:** Semantic context YAML is **only** used by `aud context`. Refactor profiles for `aud refactor --file ...` live under `theauditor/refactor/yaml_rules/` and have a different schema/engine.

## When to use semantic contexts

### Great fits
- Security migrations (JWT → OAuth2, legacy crypto → KMS, token policy changes)
- Database / schema moves when you want to label findings by rollout stage
- API/platform deprecations (REST v1 → GraphQL, SOAP → REST)
- Architecture transitions (React class → hooks, queue → event bus)
- Business/compliance rules unique to your org

### Not a fit
- Adding new detectors (use `theauditor/rules/`)
- Enforcing migration mismatches (use refactor YAML profiles)
- One-off searches (use `rg`, `aud query`, or `aud detect-patterns`)

## How TheAuditor uses this YAML

1. `aud context` loads your semantic context (via `theauditor/insights/semantic_context.py`).
2. For each finding in `findings_consolidated`, it checks the regex+scope rules:
   - **obsolete** → flagged as deprioritized
   - **current** → still important
   - **transitional** → temporarily acceptable until `expires`
3. Summaries + migration progress land in:
   - CLI output (truth courier facts only)
   - `.pf/raw/semantic_context_<name>.json`
   - `.pf/readthis/semantic_context_<name>_chunk*.json`

## Recommended workflow

1. `aud full` (or `aud detect-patterns`)
2. `aud context --file semantic_rules/<name>.yaml`
3. Optionally re-run after fixes to track migration progress

## Best practices

- **Be explicit**: Regex should match only the findings you intend (use anchors, negative lookaheads, precise scopes).
- **Use scope**: Narrow to relevant directories, exclude tests/migrations to avoid noise.
- **Severity signals intent**: `critical`/`high` for blocking obsolete findings, `low` for informational.
- **Expire transitional patterns**: Set realistic dates so they eventually flip to obsolete.
- **Document metadata**: Add owner, tickets, docs links—future you will thank you.

Questions? Open an issue on the repo or extend the documentation with your own templates. This directory is meant to stay example-rich so every team can bootstrap their own semantic contexts quickly. Remember: you provide the business logic, TheAuditor reports the facts.*** End Patch
