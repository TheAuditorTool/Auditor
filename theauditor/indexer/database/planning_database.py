"""Planning and meta-system database operations.

This module contains add_* methods for PLANNING_TABLES defined in schemas/planning_schema.py.
Handles 5 planning tables including plans, tasks, specs, code snapshots, and diffs.

NOTE: This module is currently a stub. Planning methods will be added as the
      planning system (aud planning commands) evolves. This is kept separate
      because the planning subsystem will iterate rapidly and needs clean isolation.

    """Mixin providing add_* methods for PLANNING_TABLES.

    CRITICAL: This mixin assumes self.generic_batches exists (from BaseDatabaseManager).
    DO NOT instantiate directly - only use as mixin for DatabaseManager.

    PLANNING TABLES (5 tables):
    - plans: Main planning table (id, name, description, status, metadata)
    - plan_tasks: Tasks within plans (plan_id FK, task_number, status, spec_id FK)
    - plan_specs: Specs for plans (plan_id FK, spec_yaml, spec_type)
    - code_snapshots: Code snapshots/checkpoints (plan_id FK, task_id FK, checkpoint_name, git_ref)
    - code_diffs: Diffs between snapshots (snapshot_id FK, file_path, diff_text, line counts)

    FUTURE: Add methods as planning system evolves:
    - add_plan()
    - add_plan_task()
    - add_plan_spec()
    - add_code_snapshot()
    - add_code_diff()
