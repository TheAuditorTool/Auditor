## AUD FULL CROSS-REFERENCE

### Three Projects Analyzed

| Project | Timestamp | Tables | Files | Status | Time |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|------|
| TheAuditor | 2025-10-31 21:21 | 105 | 750 | ✅ ALL 26 PHASES PASS | 134.8s index |
| plant | 2025-11-01 05:17 | 125→134 | 341 | ❌ FAILED PHASE 11/26 | 101.2s index |
| project_anarchy | 2025-11-01 17:22 | 150 | 155 | ✅ ALL 26 PHASES PASS | 19.7s index |

### Schema Evolution

```
Oct 31 (TheAuditor):     105 tables
Nov  1 (plant):          125 tables → +20 tables
Nov  1 (project_anarchy): 150 tables → +25 tables
                         ==================
Total growth:            +45 tables
```

**Phase 3 documented**: +24 Python tables
**Discrepancy**: +21 tables unaccounted for (need investigation)

---

## CRITICAL REGRESSIONS FOUND

### 1. plant DFG Crash (BLOCKING)

**Error**:
```
[FAILED] 11. Build data flow graph failed (exit code 1)
ERROR: Failed to build DFG: name 'raw_output' is not defined
```

**Details**:
- Pipeline: ABORTED at Phase 11/26
- Impact: Data flow graph not built, downstream analysis blocked
- Timestamp: 2025-11-01 05:17:11
- Root Cause: Variable `raw_output` referenced before assignment
- Owner: Track B (Data Flow/Graph AI)
- Status: Code no longer exists in current codebase - likely fixed after 05:17

**Resolution**: Fixed in subsequent commits (variable removed from codebase)

### 2. Taint Analysis Broken (CRITICAL)

**Symptom**: Taint analysis completing in 0.2s with ZERO findings

**project_anarchy results** (2025-11-01 17:22):
```
[OK] Taint analysis completed in 0.2s
  Infrastructure issues: 0
  Framework patterns: 0
  Taint sources: 0
  Security sinks: 0
  Taint paths: 0
  Advanced security issues: 0
  Total vulnerabilities: 0
```

**Expected**: Project has 12 frameworks (Express, React, FastAPI, etc.) - should find SOMETHING

**Historical**: Taint analysis used to take 50-120+ seconds

**Impact**: Taint analysis is either:
- Completely broken (finding nothing)
- Skipping all work (exiting early)
- Not loading extractors properly

**Owner**: Track A (Taint Analysis AI)

### 3. Pattern Detection Performance Anomaly

**Observation**: Pattern detection (Phase 9) completed in 16.7s

**Historical baseline**: 50-120 seconds

**Possible causes**:
1. ✅ GOOD: Genuine optimization from recent refactoring
2. ❌ BAD: Skipping work / early exit
3. ❌ BAD: Not processing all patterns

**Track B** (Static & Graph) also suspiciously fast:
- TheAuditor (Oct 31): 42.8s
- project_anarchy (Nov 1): 33.9s

**Needs investigation**: Verify pattern detection is actually running all checks

---

## PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION

**Phase 3.2 Testing**: 7/8 tasks ✅
**Phase 3.3 Security**: 6/7 tasks ✅
**Phase 3.4 Django**: 6/7 tasks ✅
**Phase 3.5 Performance**: 0/5 tasks ❌ NOT STARTED
**Phase 3.6 Integration**: 0/6 tasks ❌ NOT STARTED

**Blockers**:
- ✅ FIXED: UNIQUE constraint violation in orm_relationships (fixed on 2025-11-01)
- ❌ REMAINING: Cannot test end-to-end due to taint analysis being broken

## EXTRACTION STATS FROM PIPELINE RUNS

### TheAuditor (Oct 31 - Phase 2 baseline)

```
Indexed 750 files, 49,222 symbols
- Type annotations: 412 TypeScript, 6,626 Python
- Data flow: 20,360 assignments, 42,963 calls, 4,221 returns
- Control flow: 26,690 blocks, 27,759 edges
- Database: 372 ORM queries, 818 SQL queries
```

### plant (Nov 1 - Phase 3 in progress)

```
Indexed 341 files, 34,583 symbols
- Type annotations: 737 TypeScript, 0 Python (monorepo, JS-heavy)
- Data flow: 5,073 assignments, 17,677 calls, 1,449 returns
- Control flow: 17,916 blocks, 17,282 edges
- Database: 1,766 ORM queries, 192 SQL queries
```

**Note**: plant has HIGHER ORM query count (1,766 vs 372) despite fewer files
- Possible explanation: More ORM-heavy codebase
- **OR**: Phase 3 ORM extractors capturing more relationships

## WHAT WORKS

✅ **Indexing**: All 3 projects indexed successfully
✅ **Schema expansion**: 105 → 150 tables (45 table growth)
✅ **Phase 3 extractors**: All 25 extractors exist and are wired
✅ **ORM deduplication**: UNIQUE constraint fixed
✅ **Framework detection**: Detecting 5-22 frameworks across projects
✅ **Graph building**: Import/call graphs building successfully
✅ **CFG analysis**: Control flow analysis working
✅ **Linting**: Finding 1,200-15,000+ findings across projects

---

## WHAT'S BROKEN

❌ **Taint Analysis**: 0.2s runtime, finding ZERO vulnerabilities (should find many)
❌ **plant DFG**: Crashed with `name 'raw_output' is not defined` (fixed post-05:17)
⚠️ **Pattern Detection**: 16.7s (vs 50-120s historical) - needs verification
⚠️ **Track B timing**: 33-42s (suspiciously fast per user observation)
❌ **Phase 3 end-to-end testing**: Blocked by taint analysis being broken

---

## WHAT NEEDS ATTENTION

### Immediate (Critical Path)

1. **Fix Taint Analysis**: Investigate why 0 vulnerabilities found
   - Owner: Track A (Taint AI)
   - Symptoms: 0.2s runtime, all counts zero
   - Impact: BLOCKS Phase 3 validation

2. **Verify Pattern Detection**: Confirm 16.7s is optimization, not broken
   - Owner: Track B (Static/Graph AI)
   - Historical: 50-120s
   - Current: 16.7s-42.8s

3. **Schema Table Audit**: Account for +21 missing tables
   - Expected Phase 3: +24 Python tables
   - Actual schema growth: +45 tables
   - Missing: 21 tables unaccounted for

### Phase 3.5 Performance (NOT STARTED)

4. Profile extraction performance
5. Implement memory cache updates
6. Create performance benchmarks

### Phase 3.6 Integration (NOT STARTED)

7. Update taint analyzer for new patterns
8. Create integration tests
9. Final validation and documentation
