# Framework Extraction Parity Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Schema Implementation
- Added 9 new Node.js framework tables (Sequelize, BullMQ, Angular)
- Added 10 new Python framework tables (Marshmallow, WTForms, Celery, Pytest)
- Updated schema assertion to 150 tables total

### Phase 2: Storage Handlers
- Implemented all storage handlers for new framework tables
- Both JavaScript and Python storage methods in place

### Phase 3: Enhanced Test Fixtures
- Created complex, production-quality test fixtures:
  - **Sequelize**: Polymorphic associations, scoped associations, hooks, virtual fields, custom validators
  - **Angular**: HTTP interceptors with retry logic, rate limiting, token refresh
  - **BullMQ**: Job dependencies, rate limiting, parallel processing, graceful shutdown
  - **SQLAlchemy**: Hybrid properties, polymorphic inheritance, complex relationships
  - **Marshmallow**: Nested schemas, custom validators, cross-field validation
  - **Celery**: Chains, groups, chords, distributed locking, beat schedules

### Phase 4: JavaScript AST Improvements
- Implemented proper decorator extraction in core_ast_extractors.js
- Added decorator support for classes and functions/methods
- Updated Angular extractor to use actual decorators instead of naming conventions

### Phase 5: Python Extraction Fixes (In Progress)
- Fixed field name mismatches in Marshmallow extraction functions:
  - `schema_name` → `schema_class_name`
  - `is_required` → `required`
  - Added missing fields: `field_count`, `has_nested_schemas`, `has_custom_validators`, etc.

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### Python Extraction Functions
1. **WTForms**: Need to update field names to match storage expectations
   - `form_name` → `form_class_name`
   - Add missing field calculations

2. **Celery Tasks**: Verify field names match storage expectations
   - Check `task_name`, `decorator_name`, `arg_count`, etc.

3. **Celery Beat Schedules**: Verify field extraction
   - Ensure `schedule_name`, `schedule_type`, `schedule_expression` are extracted

4. **Pytest Fixtures**: Check field name alignment
   - Verify `fixture_name`, `scope`, etc.

## Known Limitations
- TypeScript compiler not available in sandbox environment (cannot test JS extraction fully)
- JavaScript extractors require TypeScript semantic parser for proper execution
- Some complex patterns (like dynamic imports) may not be fully captured

## Test Results
- Python extraction: Tables created successfully, but data extraction needs field name fixes
- JavaScript extraction: Cannot test due to TypeScript compiler limitation
- Storage layer: Working correctly with proper field names

## Next Steps
1. Complete fixing remaining Python extraction functions
2. Run full test suite
3. Validate extraction with complex fixtures
4. Document any remaining edge cases

## Data Flow Architecture
```
AST → Extractors → Indexer → Storage → Database
```

Each layer must use consistent field names for data to flow properly.
